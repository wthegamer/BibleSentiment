The answer can be found in the pages of the\\r\\nGospel of Matthew, a rich source of information detailing the Son of\\r\\nGod\\'s instructions from Our Father to us. Here we learn, through Jesus\\'\\r\\nteachings and actions, what we must keep of the old. We find what must\\r\\nbe replaced. We see what has been fulfilled and has come full circle.\\r\\nWe discover the new material and the new message. The Gospel of Matthew\\r\\nholds out the keys to \"this generation\\'s\" entry into the kingdom of\\r\\nheaven … if we have ears to hear and eyes to see.',\n",

       " '1\\r\\nThe birth of Jesus Christ was thus: When Mary, His mother, was espoused\\r\\nto Joseph, and before they came together, she was found with child of\\r\\nthe Holy Spirit. Joseph, a just man, not willing to make her a public\\r\\nexample, decided to put her away privately. But while he thought about\\r\\nthese things an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,\\r\\nJoseph, thou son of David, do not fear to take Mary as thy wife. The\\r\\none who is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She shall bring\\r\\nforth a son and thou shall call Him Jesus. He will save His people from\\r\\ntheir sins.',\n",
       " 'All this was done so that what was spoken of the Lord by the prophet\\r\\nmight be fulfilled: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall\\r\\nbring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, God with us.\\r\\nThen Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord told him and took\\r\\nunto him his wife. He knew her not until she brought forth her\\r\\nfirstborn son, Jesus.',\n",
       " '2\\r\\nWhen Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of King Herod,\\r\\nwise men from the east went to Jerusalem. They said, Where is He that\\r\\nis born King of the Jews for we have seen His star in the east and go\\r\\nto worship Him. When Herod heard these things, he was troubled as was\\r\\nall Jerusalem. Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes\\r\\ntogether and demanded to know where Christ would be born. They said, In\\r\\nBethlehem of Judaea. It is written by the prophet: And thou Bethlehem,\\r\\nin the land of Juda, the least among the princes of Juda, yet out of\\r\\nthee shall come a Governor that shall rule my people.',\n",
       " 'Herod called the wise men to enquire about the time the star would\\r\\nappear. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, Go and search diligently\\r\\nfor the young child. When ye have found Him bring me word that I may\\r\\ncome and worship Him also. After they met with the king they departed;\\r\\nand, lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them until it\\r\\nstood over the young child.',\n",
       " 'When they saw the star they rejoiced. The wise men came to the place\\r\\nand saw the young child with Mary, His mother. They bowed down and\\r\\nworshipped Him. They presented Him with gifts of gold, and frankincense\\r\\nand myrrh. Since they were warned by God in a dream that they should\\r\\nnot return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another\\r\\nway.',\n",
       " 'After they departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in\\r\\na dream and said, Arise and take the young child and His mother and\\r\\nflee into Egypt. Stay there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek\\r\\nthe young child to destroy Him. Joseph took the young child and His\\r\\nmother, by night, and departed into Egypt. There they remained until\\r\\nthe death of Herod. This was so it might be fulfilled what was spoken\\r\\nof the Lord by the prophet: Out of Egypt have I called my son.',\n",
       " 'Herod realized he was mocked by the wise men and was exceedingly\\r\\nwrathful. He ordered that all the children that were in Bethlehem and\\r\\nin all the coasts two years old and under be slayed. This was based on\\r\\nwhat he was told by the wise men. Then that which was spoken by Jeremy\\r\\nthe prophet was fulfilled: In Rama there was heard the sound of\\r\\nlamentation, weeping, and great mourning. Rachel was weeping for her\\r\\nchildren and would not be comforted because they are no longer.',\n",
       " \"When Herod died an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in\\r\\nEgypt. The angel said, Arise and take the young child and His mother\\r\\nand go into the land of Israel. They are now dead who sought the young\\r\\nchild's life. Joseph took the young child and His mother and started\\r\\ntoward Israel. Along the way Joseph heard that Archelaus reigned in\\r\\nJudaea in the place of his father, Herod. Joseph was afraid to go\\r\\nthere. Despite being warned by God in a dream, he turned toward\\r\\nGalilee. He came to dwell in a city called Nazareth that it might be\\r\\nfulfilled what was spoken by the prophets: He shall be called a\\r\\nNazarene.\",\n",
       " '3\\r\\nIn those days John the Baptist preached in the wilderness of Judaea. He\\r\\nmessage was, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

       " \"The same John wore camel's hair and a leathern girdle around his loins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis food was locusts and wild honey. He went out to Jerusalem. all\\r\\n\\r\\nJudaea, and all the region round Jordan. Many people were baptized by\\r\\n\\r\\nhim and confessed their sins.\\n\",\n",
       " 'But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his\\r\\nbaptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to\\r\\nflee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits fit for repentance. Do\\r\\nnot say, We have Abraham for our father, because I say to you, God is\\r\\nable  to raise up children to Abraham with these stones. The axe is now\\r\\nlaid to the root of the trees. Every tree which does not bring forth\\r\\ngood fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.',\n",
       " 'I baptize you with water for repentance but He that comes after me is\\r\\nmightier than I. His shoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptize\\r\\nyou with the Holy Ghost and with the fire whose fan is in His hand. He\\r\\nwill throughly purge His floor and gather His wheat into the garner. He\\r\\nwill burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.',\n",
       " 'When Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized by him, John\\r\\nforbad Him. He said, Why come to me? I should be baptized by thee.\\r\\nJesus answered, For now, suffer it to be so because it becomes us to\\r\\nfulfill all righteousness.',\n",
       " 'When Jesus was baptized He came up out of the water and the heavens\\r\\nopened to Him. John saw the Spirit of God descend like a dove and light\\r\\nupon Him. A voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son in whom I am\\r\\nwell pleased.',\n",
       " '4\\r\\nThen Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by\\r\\nthe devil. After He fasted forty days and forty nights He was hungry.\\r\\nThe tempter came to Him and said, If thou be the Son of God, command\\r\\nthat these stones be made bread. Jesus answered, It is written, Man\\r\\nshall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of\\r\\nthe mouth of God. The devil then took Him up into the holy city and sat\\r\\nHim on a pinnacle of the temple. He said, If thou be the Son of God,\\r\\ncast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give His angels charge\\r\\nconcerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any\\r\\ntime thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus countered Him saying, It\\r\\nis also written, Thou shalt not test the Lord thy God.',\n",
       " 'Next, the devil took Him up into an exceedingly high mountain. He\\r\\nshowed Him the kingdoms of the world in all their glory. He said, All\\r\\nthese things I will give thee if thou will bow down and worship me.\\r\\nThen Jesus said, Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt\\r\\nworship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil\\r\\nleft Him. And, behold, angels came and ministered to Him.',\n",
       " 'When Jesus heard that John was cast into prison, He departed into\\r\\nGalilee. And, leaving Nazareth, He dwelt in Capernaum on the sea coast,\\r\\nin the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim. This He did so that what was\\r\\nspoken by Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled: In the land of\\r\\nZabulon, and the land of Nephthalim by the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee\\r\\nof the Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness saw great light. And\\r\\nto those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up.\\r\\nFrom this time forward Jesus began His teaching of repentance because\\r\\nthe kingdom of God is at hand.',\n",
       " 'As Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon, called Peter, and\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew, his brother. They were fishers and were casting a net into the\\r\\n\\r\\nsea. He said to them, Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left their nets and followed Him.\\n',\n",
       " 'Going on from there, Jesus saw two other brethren, James, the son of\\r\\nZebedee, and John. They were in a boat, mending their nets, with\\r\\nZebedee, their father. Jesus called them and they immediately left the\\r\\nboat and their father and followed Him. Then Jesus went all about\\r\\nGalilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the gospel of the\\r\\nkingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and disease among the\\r\\npeople.',\n",
       " 'His fame spread throughout all Syria. They brought to Him sick people\\r\\nwho were taken with diverse diseases, torments, and those who were\\r\\npossessed with devils. They brought those who were lunatic, and those\\r\\nwho had palsy. He healed them. Great multitudes of people from Galilee,\\r\\nand from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from\\r\\nbeyond Jordan followed Him.\\r\\n5\\r\\nSeeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain and sat. His\\r\\ndisciples came and He taught them: Blessed are the poor in spirit for\\r\\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn for they\\r\\nshall be comforted. Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the\\r\\nearth. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for\\r\\nthey shall be filled.',\n",
       " \"Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the\\r\\npure of heart for they shall see God.

Blessed are they who are\\r\\npersecuted for righteousness' sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\r\\nBlessed are ye when men revile and persecute you, and say all manner of\\r\\nevil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad.\\r\\nGreat is your reward in heaven. And, likewise, they persecuted the\\r\\nprophets who were before you.\",\n",

Let your light so shine before men\\r\\nthat they see your good works reflecting only your Father in heaven.',\n",
       " 'Do not think that I came to destroy the law or the words of the\\r\\nprophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say,\\r\\nUntil heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall pass\\r\\nfrom the law until all is fulfilled. Whoever breaks one of these least\\r\\ncommandments, and teaches others to do likewise shall be called the\\r\\nleast in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall keep these least\\r\\ncommandments and teach them shall be called great in the kingdom of\\r\\nheaven.

They spit on Him, took the reed, and\\r\\nstruck Him on the head. As they were leading Him away to be crucified,\\r\\nthey found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and compelled him to carry\\r\\nthe cross for Jesus.\",\n",
       " 'They took Him to a place called Golgotha, or the place of a skull.\\r\\nThere they gave Him vinegar to drink mixed with gall. When Jesus tasted\\r\\nit, He would not drink it. They crucified Him and parted out His\\r\\ngarments by casting lots. Thus the prophecy was fulfilled: They parted\\r\\nmy garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. Then\\r\\nthe soldiers placed a written accusation over His head. It read: This\\r\\nIs Jesus, The King Of The Jews.',\n",
       " 'Two thieves were crucified alongside Jesus, one on His right hand and\\r\\nthe other on His left.

Let us see whether Elias will come to save Him.\\r\\nThen Jesus cried again in a loud voice and yielded Himself up.',\n",
       " 'Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The\\r\\nearth shook and the rocks split apart. Graves were opened. The bodies\\r\\nof many saints who slept rose up and, after His resurrection, went into\\r\\nthe holy city and appeared to many. When the centurions who were\\r\\nwatching Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that were done, they\\r\\nbecame afraid and said, Truly this was the Son of God.',\n",

Command\\r\\nthat the sepulchre be made secure until the third day lest His\\r\\ndisciples come by night, steal Him away, and tell the people that He is\\r\\nrisen from the dead. Then the last error will be worse than the first.',\n",
       " 'Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch. Go your way. Make it as secure as\\r\\nye can. The chief priests and the Pharisees went and made the sepulchre\\r\\nsecure by sealing the stone and setting guards to watch.',\n",

An angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and\\r\\nrolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance\\r\\nwas like lightning with raiment white as snow. The guards shook with\\r\\nfear of Him and became as dead men.',\n",

       "'Title: The Gospel of Matthew for Readers Editor: Lightheart Release date: May 1, 2004 [eBook #6356]\\r\\n                Most recently updated: August 21, 2012 Language: English Copyright (C) 2002 by Lightheart. The Gospel of Matthew for Readers Editor\\'s Preface What is God\\'s will for us? The answer can be found in the pages of the\\r\\nGospel of Matthew, a rich source of information detailing the Son of\\r\\nGod\\'s instructions from Our Father to us. Here we learn, through Jesus\\'\\r\\nteachings and actions, what we must keep of the old. We find what must\\r\\nbe replaced. We see what has been fulfilled and has come full circle.\\r\\nWe discover the new material and the new message. The Gospel of Matthew\\r\\nholds out the keys to \"this generation\\'s\" entry into the kingdom of\\r\\nheaven … if we have ears to hear and eyes to see. This edition of the Gospel of Matthew is designed for easy reading and\\r\\nis presented in chapter and paragraph style. The first chapter begins\\r\\nwith the birth of Jesus rather than the geneological listing which can\\r\\neasily be found at the beginning of other editions.\\r\\nedited by Lightheart\\r\\nPracticeGodsPresence.com 1\\r\\nThe birth of Jesus Christ was thus: When Mary, His mother, was espoused\\r\\nto Joseph, and before they came together, she was found with child of\\r\\nthe Holy Spirit. Joseph, a just man, not willing to make her a public\\r\\nexample, decided to put her away privately. But while he thought about\\r\\nthese things an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,\\r\\nJoseph, thou son of David, do not fear to take Mary as thy wife. The\\r\\none who is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She shall bring\\r\\nforth a son and thou shall call Him Jesus. He will save His people from\\r\\ntheir sins. All this was done so that what was spoken of the Lord by the prophet\\r\\nmight be fulfilled: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall\\r\\nbring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, God with us.\\r\\nThen Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord told him and took\\r\\nunto him his wife. He knew her not until she brought forth her\\r\\nfirstborn son, Jesus. 2\\r\\nWhen Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of King Herod,\\r\\nwise men from the east went to Jerusalem. They said, Where is He that\\r\\nis born King of the Jews for we have seen His star in the east and go\\r\\nto worship Him. When Herod heard these things, he was troubled as was\\r\\nall Jerusalem. Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes\\r\\ntogether and demanded to know where Christ would be born. They said, In\\r\\nBethlehem of Judaea. It is written by the prophet: And thou Bethlehem,\\r\\nin the land of Juda, the least among the princes of Juda, yet out of\\r\\nthee shall come a Governor that shall rule my people. Herod called the wise men to enquire about the time the star would\\r\\nappear. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, Go and search diligently\\r\\nfor the young child. When ye have found Him bring me word that I may\\r\\ncome and worship Him also. After they met with the king they departed;\\r\\nand, lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them until it\\r\\nstood over the young child. When they saw the star they rejoiced. The wise men came to the place\\r\\nand saw the young child with Mary, His mother. They bowed down and\\r\\nworshipped Him. They presented Him with gifts of gold, and frankincense\\r\\nand myrrh. Since they were warned by God in a dream that they should\\r\\nnot return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another\\r\\nway. After they departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in\\r\\na dream and said, Arise and take the young child and His mother and\\r\\nflee into Egypt. Stay there until I bring thee word for Herod will seek\\r\\nthe young child to destroy Him. Joseph took the young child and His\\r\\nmother, by night, and departed into Egypt. There they remained until\\r\\nthe death of Herod. This was so it might be fulfilled what was spoken\\r\\nof the Lord by the prophet: Out of Egypt have I called my son. Herod realized he was mocked by the wise men and was exceedingly\\r\\nwrathful. He ordered that all the children that were in Bethlehem and\\r\\nin all the coasts two years old and under be slayed. This was based on\\r\\nwhat he was told by the wise men. Then that which was spoken by Jeremy\\r\\nthe prophet was fulfilled: In Rama there was heard the sound of\\r\\nlamentation, weeping, and great mourning. Rachel was weeping for her\\r\\nchildren and would not be comforted because they are no longer. When Herod died an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in\\r\\nEgypt. The angel said, Arise and take the young child and His mother\\r\\nand go into the land of Israel. They are now dead who sought the young\\r\\nchild\\'s life. Joseph took the young child and His mother and started\\r\\ntoward Israel. Along the way Joseph heard that Archelaus reigned in\\r\\nJudaea in the place of his father, Herod. Joseph was afraid to go\\r\\nthere. Despite being warned by God in a dream, he turned toward\\r\\nGalilee. He came to dwell in a city called Nazareth that it might be\\r\\nfulfilled what was spoken by the prophets: He shall be called a\\r\\nNazarene. 3\\r\\nIn those days John the Baptist preached in the wilderness of Judaea. He\\r\\nmessage was, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. John is the\\r\\none that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias: The voice of one crying\\r\\nin the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make His paths\\r\\nstraight. The same John wore camel\\'s hair and a leathern girdle around his loins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis food was locusts and wild honey. He went out to Jerusalem. all\\r\\n\\r\\nJudaea, and all the region round Jordan. Many people were baptized by\\r\\n\\r\\nhim and confessed their sins.\\n But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his\\r\\nbaptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to\\r\\nflee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits fit for repentance. Do\\r\\nnot say, We have Abraham for our father, because I say to you, God is\\r\\nable  to raise up children to Abraham with these stones. The axe is now\\r\\nlaid to the root of the trees. Every tree which does not bring forth\\r\\ngood fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. I baptize you with water for repentance but He that comes after me is\\r\\nmightier than I. His shoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptize\\r\\nyou with the Holy Ghost and with the fire whose fan is in His hand. He\\r\\nwill throughly purge His floor and gather His wheat into the garner. He\\r\\nwill burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. When Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized by him, John\\r\\nforbad Him. He said, Why come to me? I should be baptized by thee.\\r\\nJesus answered, For now, suffer it to be so because it becomes us to\\r\\nfulfill all righteousness. When Jesus was baptized He came up out of the water and the heavens\\r\\nopened to Him. John saw the Spirit of God descend like a dove and light\\r\\nupon Him. A voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son in whom I am\\r\\nwell pleased. 4\\r\\nThen Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by\\r\\nthe devil. After He fasted forty days and forty nights He was hungry.\\r\\nThe tempter came to Him and said, If thou be the Son of God, command\\r\\nthat these stones be made bread. Jesus answered, It is written, Man\\r\\nshall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of\\r\\nthe mouth of God. The devil then took Him up into the holy city and sat\\r\\nHim on a pinnacle of the temple. He said, If thou be the Son of God,\\r\\ncast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give His angels charge\\r\\nconcerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any\\r\\ntime thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus countered Him saying, It\\r\\nis also written, Thou shalt not test the Lord thy God. Next, the devil took Him up into an exceedingly high mountain. He\\r\\nshowed Him the kingdoms of the world in all their glory. He said, All\\r\\nthese things I will give thee if thou will bow down and worship me.\\r\\nThen Jesus said, Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt\\r\\nworship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil\\r\\nleft Him. And, behold, angels came and ministered to Him. When Jesus heard that John was cast into prison, He departed into\\r\\nGalilee. And, leaving Nazareth, He dwelt in Capernaum on the sea coast,\\r\\nin the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim. This He did so that what was\\r\\nspoken by Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled: In the land of\\r\\nZabulon, and the land of Nephthalim by the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee\\r\\nof the Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness saw great light. And\\r\\nto those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up.\\r\\nFrom this time forward Jesus began His teaching of repentance because\\r\\nthe kingdom of God is at hand. As Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon, called Peter, and\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew, his brother. They were fishers and were casting a net into the\\r\\n\\r\\nsea. He said to them, Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left their nets and followed Him.\\n Going on from there, Jesus saw two other brethren, James, the son of\\r\\nZebedee, and John. They were in a boat, mending their nets, with\\r\\nZebedee, their father. Jesus called them and they immediately left the\\r\\nboat and their father and followed Him. Then Jesus went all about\\r\\nGalilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the gospel of the\\r\\nkingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and disease among the\\r\\npeople. His fame spread throughout all Syria. They brought to Him sick people\\r\\nwho were taken with diverse diseases, torments, and those who were\\r\\npossessed with devils. They brought those who were lunatic, and those\\r\\nwho had palsy. He healed them. Great multitudes of people from Galilee,\\r\\nand from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from\\r\\nbeyond Jordan followed Him.\\r\\n5\\r\\nSeeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain and sat. His\\r\\ndisciples came and He taught them: Blessed are the poor in spirit for\\r\\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn for they\\r\\nshall be comforted. Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the\\r\\nearth. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for\\r\\nthey shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the\\r\\npure of heart for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers for\\r\\nthey shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they who are\\r\\npersecuted for righteousness\\' sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\r\\nBlessed are ye when men revile and persecute you, and say all manner of\\r\\nevil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad.\\r\\nGreat is your reward in heaven. And, likewise, they persecuted the\\r\\nprophets who were before you. Ye are the salt of the earth. If the salt loses its savour it is good\\r\\nfor nothing except to be cast out and walked on. Ye are the light of\\r\\nthe world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. A candle is\\r\\nnot lighted to be put under a bushel, but on a candlestick. This way it\\r\\ngives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before men\\r\\nthat they see your good works reflecting only your Father in heaven. Do not think that I came to destroy the law or the words of the\\r\\nprophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say,\\r\\nUntil heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall pass\\r\\nfrom the law until all is fulfilled. Whoever breaks one of these least\\r\\ncommandments, and teaches others to do likewise shall be called the\\r\\nleast in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall keep these least\\r\\ncommandments and teach them shall be called great in the kingdom of\\r\\nheaven. Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the\\r\\nscribes and Pharisees, there is no way ye shall enter the kingdom of\\r\\nheaven. Ye have heard it was said of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whoever\\r\\nshall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say to you,\\r\\nWhoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment.\\r\\nWhoever shows contempt toward his brother shall be in danger of the\\r\\ncouncil. But whosoever curses his brother is in danger of hell fire. So, if thou bring a gift to the altar and then remember that thy\\r\\nbrother has something against thee, leave the gift before the altar. Be\\r\\nreconciled to thy brother first. Then come back and offer thy gift.\\r\\nAgree with thine adversary quickly while thou art with him; lest, at\\r\\nany time, thy adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge\\r\\ndeliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say\\r\\nunto thee, Thou shalt not come out then until all is paid. Ye have heard it said by them of old, Thou shalt not commit adultery.\\r\\nBut I say, Whoever looks on a woman in lust has already committed\\r\\nadultery in his heart. If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and\\r\\ncast it away. It is more profitable for thee that one of thy members\\r\\nshould perish rather than thy whole body be cast into hell. And if thy\\r\\nright hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee. It is more\\r\\nprofitable for thee that one of thy members should perish rather than\\r\\nthy whole body be cast into hell. It has been said, Whoever puts away his wife shall give her a writing\\r\\nof divorcement. But I say, Whoever puts away his wife, except for\\r\\nreason of fornication, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever\\r\\nmarries her that is divorced commits adultery. Also, ye have heard it said by them of old, Thou shalt not forswear\\r\\nthyself but perform your oaths unto the Lord. But I say, take no oaths\\r\\nat all. Do not swear by heaven because it is God\\'s throne. Do not swear\\r\\nby the earth because it is His footstool. Do not swear by Jerusalem for\\r\\nit is the city of the great King. Do not swear by thy self because you\\r\\nare incapable of making even one hair white or black. Let your\\r\\nstatement be only Yea, yes; Nay, no: for anything more than this comes\\r\\nto evil. Ye have heard it said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I\\r\\nsay, Do not resist evil. Whoever strikes thee on thy right cheek, turn\\r\\nthe other to him also. And, if any one lawfully sues thee and takes\\r\\naway thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. Whoever compels thee to go\\r\\na mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks of thee. From him who\\r\\nwould borrow of thee, do not turn away. Ye have heard it said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine\\r\\nenemy. But I say, Love your enemy. Bless those who curse you. Do good\\r\\nto those who hate you. Pray for those who spitefully use and persecute\\r\\nyou. Do this that ye may be the children of your Father in heaven. He makes\\r\\nHis sun rise on the evil and on the good. He sends rain on the just and\\r\\non the unjust. If ye love only those who love you, what reward have ye?\\r\\nDo not even the publicans do this? And if ye greet your friends only,\\r\\nwhat do ye do more than others? Do not even the publicans do this?\\r\\nInstead be ye as perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect. 6\\r\\nTake heed that ye do not do your almsgiving to be seen by others. If\\r\\nso, ye have no reward from your Father in heaven. When you give, do not\\r\\nsound a trumpet in the synagogues and in the streets as do the\\r\\nhypocrites. They seek the glory of men. Verily, I say unto you, They\\r\\nhave their reward. When you give alms, do not let thy left hand know what thy right does.\\r\\nGive alms in secret and thy Father, who sees in secret, shall reward\\r\\nthee openly. When thou pray, thou shalt not be like the hypocrites. They love to\\r\\npray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so\\r\\nthey may be seen. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward. When thou pray, enter into thy closet. When thou has shut thy door,\\r\\npray to thy Father in secret. Thy Father, who sees in secret, shall\\r\\nreward thee openly. When ye pray, do not use vain repetitions like the heathen. They think\\r\\nthat they shall be heard for their long speaking. Be not like them.\\r\\nYour Father knows what things ye need even before ye ask Him. Pray like this: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy\\r\\nkingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us\\r\\nthis day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our\\r\\ndebtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For\\r\\nThine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen. If ye forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also\\r\\nforgive you. But if ye do not forgive others their trespasses, neither\\r\\nwill your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover, when ye fast, be\\r\\nnot as the hypocrites. They disfigure their faces and look sad so they\\r\\nmay appear to others to fast. Verily, I say unto you, They have their\\r\\nreward. However, when thou fast, anoint thy head and wash thy face so that thou\\r\\nnot appear to fast. Keep secret except unto thy Father, who is in\\r\\nsecret, and thy Father shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust\\r\\ncorrupts, and where thieves break in and steal. Instead, lay up\\r\\ntreasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, nor thieves\\r\\ncan break in and steal. For, where your treasure is, there, also, will\\r\\nbe your heart. The light of the body is the eye. If thine eye be single, thy whole\\r\\nbody shall be full of light. But, if thine eye be evil, thy whole body\\r\\nshall be full of darkness. And, if the light that is in thee becomes\\r\\ndarkness, how much greater will be that darkness! No man can serve two masters. He will either hate the one and love the\\r\\nother, or he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot\\r\\nserve God and mammon. Therefore, I say unto you, Take no concern for\\r\\nyour life: what ye shall eat, what ye shall drink; nor for your body:\\r\\nwhat ye shall put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than\\r\\nraiment?  Behold the fowls of the air. They sow not, and neither do\\r\\nthey reap nor gather into barns. Yet, your heavenly Father feeds them.\\r\\nAre ye not worth as much as they are? And, who of you, by worrying, can\\r\\nadd one cubit to his stature? So why take thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field and how they grow. They toil not and\\r\\nneither do they spin. Even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed\\r\\nlike one of them. So, if God so clothes the grass of the field, which\\r\\ntoday is here and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not clothe\\r\\nyou even more, O ye of little faith? So, take no concern by saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we\\r\\ndrink? or, How shall we be clothed? Your heavenly Father knows that ye\\r\\nneed all these things. Instead, seek ye first the kingdom of God and\\r\\nHis righteousness. Then all these things shall be added unto you. Take\\r\\nno thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take care of itself.\\r\\nThe cares of today are sufficient for today. 7\\r\\nJudge not that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye\\r\\nshall be judged. And with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to\\r\\nyou again. Why behold the mote in thy brother\\'s eye, but not consider the beam in\\r\\nthine own eye? How can you say to thy brother, Let me pull the mote out\\r\\nof thine eye when, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite.\\r\\nFirst, cast out the beam from thine own eye, then thou shall see\\r\\nclearly enough to cast the mote from thy brother\\'s eye. Do not give that which is holy to dogs. And do not cast your pearls\\r\\nbefore swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn around\\r\\nand rend you. Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it\\r\\nshall be opened to you. Who of you is there who, if his son asks for\\r\\nbread, will give him a stone? Or, if he asks for a fish, will give him\\r\\na serpent? If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your\\r\\nchildren, how much more shall your Father in heaven give good things to\\r\\nthose who ask Him? Therefore, all things ye would have others do to\\r\\nyou, do so to them. This is the law and the meaning of the prophets. Enter in at the strait gate. Wide is the gate and broad is the way that\\r\\nleads to destruction. Many go in that way. Because the gate is strait\\r\\nand the way that leads to life is narrow, there are few who find it. Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep\\'s clothing but are\\r\\ninwardly ravenous wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men\\r\\ngather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? No, every good tree\\r\\nbrings forth good fruit. A corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit. A good\\r\\ntree cannot bring forth evil fruit. A corrupt tree cannot bring forth\\r\\ngood fruit. Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn\\r\\ndown and cast into the fire. So, by their fruits ye shall know them. Now, not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the\\r\\nkingdom of heaven. Only he who does the will of my Father in heaven\\r\\nshall enter. Many will say to me, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in\\r\\nthy name? In thy name have we not cast out devils? And, in thy name,\\r\\nhave we not done many wonderful works? Then will I say to them, I never\\r\\nknew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Whoever hears these sayings and does them, I liken to a wise man who\\r\\nbuilt his house upon a rock. When the rain descended, and the floods\\r\\ncame, and the winds blew and beat upon the house, it did not fall\\r\\nbecause it was founded upon a rock. Whoever hears these sayings and does not do them I liken to a foolish\\r\\nman who built his house upon the sand. When the rain descended, and the\\r\\nfloods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, it fell. And\\r\\na great fall it was. When Jesus finished these sayings, people were astonished at His\\r\\ndoctrine because He taught as one having authority different from the\\r\\nscribes. 8\\r\\nWhen He came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.\\r\\nAnd, behold, there came a leper who worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if\\r\\nThou will, Thou can make me clean. Jesus put out His hand, touched him,\\r\\nand said, Be thou clean. Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. Then\\r\\nJesus said to him, See that thou tell no man. Go thy way, show thyself\\r\\nto the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony. Then, when Jesus was in Capernaum, a centurion beseeched Him saying,\\r\\nLord, my servant lies at home sick with palsy and grievously tormented.\\r\\nJesus said to him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered,\\r\\nLord, I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof, but only\\r\\ngive the word and my servant shall be healed. I am a man of authority,\\r\\nunderstand commands, and have soldiers under me. I command this man,\\r\\nGo, and he goes. To another I say, Come, and he comes. I direct my\\r\\nservant to do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard this, He marvelled and said to those who followed,\\r\\nVerily, I say unto you, I have not found such great faith anywhere, no,\\r\\nnot even in Israel. And I say to you, Many shall come from the east and\\r\\nwest and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the\\r\\nkingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out\\r\\ninto darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Jesus said\\r\\nto the centurion, Go thy way. As thou has believed, so be it done unto\\r\\nthee. And the servant was healed that same hour. When Jesus went to Peter\\'s house, He saw Peter\\'s wife\\'s mother laid\\r\\nsick with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her. She\\r\\narose and ministered to them. That evening they brought to Him many\\r\\nthat were possessed with devils and He cast out the spirits with His\\r\\nword. He healed all who were sick so that it might be fulfilled what\\r\\nwas spoken by Esaias the prophet: He took our infirmities and bore our\\r\\nsicknesses. Jesus saw great multitudes gathering. He decided they should depart to\\r\\nthe other side of the water. A scribe approached Him and said, Master,\\r\\nI will follow wherever thou go. Jesus only replied, The foxes have\\r\\nholes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has no\\r\\nplace to lay His head. Another came to Him and said, Lord, let me first\\r\\ngo and bury my father. But Jesus replied, Follow me and let the dead\\r\\nbury their dead. Then they got in a boat and started for the other\\r\\nside. Behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea. It was so great that\\r\\nthe boat was covered with the waves. Jesus was asleep. His disciples\\r\\nwoke Him and said, Lord, save us. We will perish. Jesus replied, Why\\r\\nare ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then He got up and rebuked the\\r\\nwinds and the sea. There was a great calm. The disciples marvelled and\\r\\nsaid, What kind of man is this who even the winds and the sea obey! On the other side they came into the country of the Gergesenes. There\\r\\nHe met two men coming out of the tombs who were possessed with devils\\r\\nso fierce that no man dared pass them. They cried out, What have we to\\r\\ndo with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? Art thou come here to torment us\\r\\nbefore the time? At a distance from them was a herd of swine. The devils said to Him, If\\r\\nthou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine. Jesus said to\\r\\nthem, Go. When they came out of the men, they went into the herd of\\r\\nswine. Behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place\\r\\ninto the sea and perished in the waters. The herders who kept them fled\\r\\ninto the city and told everything including what happened to those\\r\\npossessed by the devils. Then the whole city came out to see Jesus and,\\r\\nwhen they saw Him, they besought Him to depart from their coasts. 9\\r\\nHe took a boat to His own city. There they brought to Him a man with\\r\\npalsy who was lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the\\r\\nsick man; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven thee. Behold, certain of the scribes said, This man blasphemes. And, Jesus\\r\\nknowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? Is\\r\\nit easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee or Arise and walk? So ye\\r\\nmay know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then\\r\\nHe said to the sick man) Arise, take up thy bed and go to thy house.\\r\\nThe man did get up and went to his house. When the multitude saw it,\\r\\nthey marvelled and glorified God who had given such power. When Jesus left there He saw a man sitting at the receipt of custom. He\\r\\nsaid to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed Him. As Jesus sat at\\r\\ndinner, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Him and His\\r\\ndisciples. When the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why\\r\\ndoes your master eat with publicans and sinners? When Jesus heard this,\\r\\nHe said, Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are\\r\\nsick do. Go and learn what that means. I will have mercy and not\\r\\nrevenge because I have not come to call the righteous, but to call\\r\\nsinners to repentance. Then John\\'s disciples came to Him and asked, Why do we and the\\r\\nPharisees often fast, but thy disciples do not fast? Jesus said to\\r\\nthem, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the\\r\\nbridegroom is with them? The day will come when the bridegroom will be\\r\\ntaken from them and then they will fast. No man uses a piece of new cloth to patch an old garment for that which\\r\\nis put in to cover the space takes from the garment and the rent is\\r\\nworse than before. Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else\\r\\nthe bottles break, the wine runs out and the bottles perish. They put\\r\\nnew wine into new bottles and both are preserved. While He spoke these\\r\\nthings there came a certain ruler who worshipped Him and said, My\\r\\ndaughter is almost now dead, but come and lay thy hand upon her and she\\r\\nshall live. Jesus arose and followed him, and His disciples came along\\r\\nalso. On the way, a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood for twelve\\r\\nyears came up behind Him. She touched the hem of His garment because\\r\\nshe said within herself, If I may but touch His garment I shall be\\r\\nhealed. Jesus turned around, and when He saw her, He said, Daughter, be\\r\\nof good comfort; thy faith has made thee whole. The woman was healed\\r\\nfrom that hour. Finally, when Jesus arrived at the ruler\\'s house, He saw many mourners.\\r\\nHe said to them, Stand aside. The maid is not dead but sleeps. They\\r\\nlaughed Him to scorn. But when the people moved aside, He went in, took\\r\\nher by the hand, and she arose. This news spread abroad into all that\\r\\nland. When Jesus left there, two blind men followed Him. They cried, Thou son\\r\\nof David, have mercy on us. When He entered a house, the blind men came\\r\\nto Him. Jesus said to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They\\r\\nsaid to Him, Yea, Lord. Then He touched their eyes and said, According\\r\\nto your faith be it done unto you. Their eyes were opened. Then Jesus\\r\\ncharged them to make sure that no man knew of this. But, after they\\r\\ndeparted, they spread His fame all around that country. As they were leaving that place a mute man possessed with a devil was\\r\\nbrought to Jesus. When the devil was cast out, the man could then\\r\\nspeak. The multitude marvelled and said nothing like it was ever before\\r\\nseen in Israel. But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the\\r\\nprince of the devils. Jesus went to all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues\\r\\nand preaching the gospel of the kingdom. He healed every kind of\\r\\nsickness and disease among the people. But when He saw the crowds, He\\r\\nwas moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were\\r\\nscattered like sheep without a shepherd. Then He said to His disciples,\\r\\nThe harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray to the\\r\\nLord so He will send forth laborers to His harvest. 10\\r\\n\\r\\nJesus called together His twelve disciples and gave them power to cast\\r\\n\\r\\nout unclean spirits and to heal all manner of sickness and disease. The\\r\\n\\r\\nnames of the twelve apostles are these; Simon, who is called Peter,\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee, John his brother;\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip; Bartholomew; Thomas; the publican; James the son of Alphaeus;\\r\\n\\r\\nLebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite; and Judas\\r\\n\\r\\nIscariot, who also betrayed Him.\\n These twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them: Go not into the way\\r\\nof the Gentiles or into any city of the Samaritans. Rather, go to the\\r\\nlost sheep of the house of Israel. As ye go, preach that the kingdom of\\r\\nheaven is at hand. Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead.\\r\\nCast out devils. Freely ye have received, freely give. Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses. Take no scrip\\r\\nfor your journey. Neither take two coats, nor shoes, nor staves because\\r\\nthe workman is worthy of his food. Into whatever city or town ye enter,\\r\\nenquire who in it is worthy. Abide there until ye go on. When ye come\\r\\ninto a house, salute it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come\\r\\nupon it. If it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. Whoever\\r\\nshall not receive you or hear your words, when ye leave that house or\\r\\ncity, shake the dust from your feet. Verily I say unto you, It shall be\\r\\nmore tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of\\r\\njudgment than for that city. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be wise as\\r\\nserpents and harmless as doves. Beware of men. They will deliver you up\\r\\nto the councils. They will scourge you in their synagogues. Ye shall be\\r\\nbrought before governors and kings for a testimony against them and the\\r\\nGentiles because of me. But when they deliver you up, do not worry how\\r\\nor what ye shall speak. It will be given you at the time ye speak\\r\\nbecause it is not ye that will speak, but the Spirit of your Father\\r\\nwhich speaks through you. Also be aware that a brother shall deliver up a brother to death, and a\\r\\nfather the child. Children shall rise up against their parents and\\r\\ncause them to be put to death. Ye shall be hated of all men for my\\r\\nname\\'s sake. But he that endures to the end shall be saved. When they\\r\\npersecute you in one city, flee to another. Verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone to all the cities of\\r\\nIsrael before the Son comes. The disciple is not above his master, nor\\r\\nthe servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as\\r\\nhis master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master\\r\\nof the house, Beelzebub, how much more shall they call those of God\\'s\\r\\nhousehold? Fear them not. There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; and\\r\\nnothing hid that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness, speak\\r\\nye in light. And what ye hear in the ear, preach that upon the\\r\\nhousetops. Fear not those who kill the body but are not able to kill\\r\\nthe soul. Instead, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body\\r\\nin hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? Yet not one of them falls to\\r\\nthe ground without your Father knowing. The very hairs of your head are\\r\\nall numbered by Him. Fear not because ye are of more value than many\\r\\nsparrows. Whoever confesses me before men, I will confess him before my\\r\\nFather in heaven. Whoever denies me before men, I will deny him before\\r\\nmy Father in heaven. Think not that I came to earth to send peace. I came not to send peace,\\r\\nbut a sword. My coming will set a man against his father, and a\\r\\ndaughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her\\r\\nmother-in-law. A man\\'s foes shall be those of his own household. He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. He\\r\\nthat loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he\\r\\nthat does not take up his cross and follow me, is not worthy of me. He that finds his life shall lose it. He that loses his life for my\\r\\nsake shall find it. He that receives you receives me, and he that\\r\\nreceives me receives Him that sent me. He that receives a prophet in\\r\\nthe name of a prophet shall receive a prophet\\'s reward. He that\\r\\nreceives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a\\r\\nrighteous man\\'s reward. And whoever shall give to one of the little\\r\\nones a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, he shall\\r\\nnever lose his reward. 11\\r\\nWhen Jesus finished instructing His twelve disciples, He departed to\\r\\nteach and preach in their cities. When John, who was in prison, heard\\r\\nof the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples. They asked Jesus,\\r\\nArt thou He that should come or do we look for another? Jesus answered,\\r\\nGo and show John those things which ye hear and see. The blind receive\\r\\ntheir sight. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The\\r\\ndead are raised up. And the poor have the gospel preached to them.\\r\\nBlessed is he, who shall not be offended in me. As they departed, Jesus spoke to the crowds concerning John saying,\\r\\nWhat went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the\\r\\nwind? What went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold,\\r\\nthey that wear soft clothing are in kings\\' houses. What went ye out to\\r\\nsee? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and he is more than a prophet.\\r\\nThis is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before\\r\\nthy face who shall prepare the way before thee. Verily I say unto you, Among those born of woman there has not risen\\r\\none greater than John the Baptist who would make himself least in the\\r\\nkingdom of heaven. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the\\r\\nkingdom of heaven suffered violence and the violent took it by force.\\r\\nAll the prophets and the law prophesied of John. If ye will receive it,\\r\\nthis is Elias, who was to come. He that has ears to hear, let him hear. But how shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in\\r\\nthe markets and calling unto their fellows saying, We have piped to you\\r\\nand ye have not danced. We have mourned you and ye have not lamented.\\r\\nJohn came neither eating nor drinking and they say he had a devil. The\\r\\nSon of man came eating and drinking and they say he is a gluttonous\\r\\nman, a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom shall\\r\\nbe justified of her children. Then He began to upbraid the cities where most of His mighty works were\\r\\ndone because they did not repent. Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto\\r\\nthee, Bethsaida! If the mighty works which were done in you had been\\r\\ndone in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth\\r\\nand ashes. But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and\\r\\nSidon at the day of judgment than for you. And Capernaum, exalted unto\\r\\nheaven, shall be brought down to hell. If the mighty works which have\\r\\nbeen done in Capernaum had been done in Sodom, it would have remained\\r\\nuntil this day. But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the\\r\\nland of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee. Then Jesus prayed aloud: I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and\\r\\nearth, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and\\r\\nrevealed them to babes. It is so, Father, for it seemed good in thy\\r\\nsight. All things are delivered to me by my Father. No man knows the Son but\\r\\nthe Father. Neither knows any man the Father except the Son. He is\\r\\nrevealed to whomever the Son will reveal Him. Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you\\r\\nrest. Take up my yoke and learn from me. I am meek and lowly in heart.\\r\\nYe shall find rest for your souls because my yoke is easy and my burden\\r\\nis light. 12\\r\\nIt was a sabbath day when Jesus and His disciples passed through a\\r\\ncornfield. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears of corn to\\r\\neat. When the Pharisees saw it, they said to Jesus, Behold, thy\\r\\ndisciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath day. But\\r\\nJesus answered them, Have ye not read what David did when he was\\r\\nhungry? He and those who were with him entered into the house of God\\r\\nand ate the showbread. This was not lawful for him to eat, nor for\\r\\nthose with him because the bread was only for the priests. And, have ye not read in the law how on the sabbath days the priests in\\r\\nthe temple profane the sabbath and are blameless? But I say unto you,\\r\\nHere is one greater than the temple. If ye knew what this meant, ye\\r\\nwould not have condemned the guiltless because the Son of man is Lord\\r\\neven of the sabbath day. When Jesus went into the synagogue He was met by a man who had a\\r\\nwithered hand. So that they might accuse Jesus, the Pharisees asked\\r\\nHim, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? Jesus replied, What man\\r\\nis there among you who has one sheep and, if it falls into a pit on the\\r\\nsabbath day, will not lay hold on it and lift it out? How much more is\\r\\na man worth than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the\\r\\nsabbath day. Jesus turned to the man and said, Stretch forth thine\\r\\nhand. The man stretched it forth and it was restored, whole and like\\r\\nhis other hand. Then the Pharisees left and held a council about how they might destroy\\r\\nJesus. But when Jesus knew this, He departed from there. Great\\r\\nmultitudes followed Him and He healed them all. He charged them that\\r\\nthey should not make Him known. This was done to fulfill what was\\r\\nspoken by Esaias the prophet: Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my\\r\\nbeloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my spirit upon Him\\r\\nand He shall show judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor\\r\\ncry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised\\r\\nreed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench till He\\r\\nsend forth judgment unto victory. And in His name the Gentiles shall\\r\\ntrust. Then a blind and mute man who was possessed with a devil, was brought\\r\\nto Him. Jesus healed him, and, to such an extent, that he both spoke\\r\\nand saw. All the people were amazed and said, Is not this the son of\\r\\nDavid? But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This one casts out\\r\\ndevils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. Jesus knew their thoughts and said, Every kingdom divided against\\r\\nitself is brought to desolation. Every city or house divided against\\r\\nitself shall not stand. If Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against\\r\\nhimself. How, then, shall his kingdom stand? If I, by Beelzebub, cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them\\r\\nout? Therefore, they shall be your judges. But, if I cast out devils by\\r\\nthe Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. And, if\\r\\nnot, then how can someone enter into a strong man\\'s house and spoil his\\r\\ngoods unless he first bind the strong man? Only then is he able to\\r\\nspoil his house. He that is not with me is against me. He that gathers not with me\\r\\nscatters abroad. So I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy\\r\\nagainst men shall be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Ghost\\r\\nshall not be forgiven. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven Him.\\r\\nBut whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven\\r\\nHim; not in this world and not in the world to come. Either make the\\r\\ntree good and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt and its\\r\\nfruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit. O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? Out\\r\\nof the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man, out of the\\r\\ngood treasure of the heart, brings forth good things. An evil man, out\\r\\nof the evil of the heart, brings forth evil things. I say to you, For every idle word that a man speaks, he shall account\\r\\nfor it in the day of judgment. By thy words thou shall be justified and\\r\\nby thy words thou shall be condemned. Then, some of the scribes and Pharisees said, Master, we want to see a\\r\\nsign from thee. But Jesus answered, An evil and adulterous generation\\r\\nseeks after a sign. There shall be no sign given except the sign of the\\r\\nprophet Jonas. Just as Jonas was three days and three nights in the\\r\\nwhale\\'s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights\\r\\nin the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment of this generation and shall\\r\\ncondemn it. This is so because they repented at the preaching of Jonas.\\r\\nBehold, one greater than Jonas is here. The queen of the south shall\\r\\nrise up in the judgment of this generation and shall condemn it. She\\r\\ncame from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of\\r\\nSolomon and, behold, one greater than Solomon is here. When an unclean spirit has left a man, he wanders through dry places,\\r\\nseeking rest, and finds none. Then the unclean spirit says, I will\\r\\nreturn to the house from which I came. When he comes, he finds it\\r\\nempty, swept, and garnished. Then he returns with seven other spirits\\r\\nmore wicked than himself. They go back into the man and dwell there.\\r\\nThen the last state of that man is worse than the first. This is how it\\r\\nshall be with this wicked generation. While Jesus continued to talk to the people, His mother and His\\r\\nbrethren stood outside and requested to speak with Him. Someone\\r\\nreported this to Him saying, Behold, thy mother and brethren are\\r\\noutside and desire to speak with thee. But Jesus addressed the one that\\r\\ntold Him by saying, Who is my mother and who are my brethren? Then He\\r\\nstretched forth His hand toward His disciples and said, Behold, my\\r\\nmother and my brethren! Whoever shall do the will of my Father in\\r\\nheaven is my brother, and sister, and mother. 13\\r\\nThat same day Jesus sat by the sea. Great multitudes gathered. He had\\r\\nto get into a boat and sit while the whole multitude stood on the\\r\\nshore. Then He taught them in parables. Jesus said, Behold, a sower went forth to sow seed. When he sowed, some\\r\\nseeds fell by the wayside and the birds came and devoured them. Some\\r\\nfell upon stony places where there was not much earth. They sprang up\\r\\nbut they had no deep roots. So, when the sun was up, they were scorched\\r\\nand withered away. Also, some of the seeds fell among thorns. The\\r\\nthorns sprang up and choked them. Yet other seeds fell on good ground.\\r\\nThese brought forth fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some\\r\\nthirtyfold. Who has ears to hear, let him hear. The disciples asked Jesus, Why do you speak to them in parables? He\\r\\nanswered, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the\\r\\nkingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. For whoever has\\r\\nunderstanding, more shall be given him and he shall have abundance. But\\r\\nwhoever does not have understanding, what little he has shall be taken\\r\\naway from him. Therefore, I speak to them in parables because, not\\r\\nseeing and not hearing, they do not understand. Also, in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias: By hearing ye shall\\r\\nhear and shall not understand. And by seeing ye shall see and shall not\\r\\nperceive. For the people\\'s hearts are hardened. Their ears are dull of\\r\\nhearing. They have closed their eyes. They do not see or hear for fear\\r\\nthey will be converted and have to change their hearts. But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.\\r\\nMany prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye\\r\\nsee and they have not seen them. They have desired to hear the things\\r\\nwhich ye hear, and have not heard them. So, again, listen to the\\r\\nparable of the sower. When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it,\\r\\nthe wicked one snatches away all that was sown in his heart. This is\\r\\nthe one who received seed by the wayside. Now he that received the seed\\r\\nin the stony places, received the word with joy. But he has no deep\\r\\nroot and endures only for a while. When tribulation or persecution\\r\\narises he is uprooted. Now the one that received seed among the thorns\\r\\nhears the word but is too much ensnared by things of this world and the\\r\\ndeceitfulness of riches. The understanding of the word is choked out\\r\\nand he becomes unfruitful. Finally, the one that received seed in the\\r\\ngood ground is he that hears the word, understands it, and bears fruit.\\r\\nHe brings forth a hundredfold or sixty or thirty. He spoke another parable saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man\\r\\nwho sowed good seed in his field. But, during the night, his enemy came\\r\\nand sowed weeds among the wheat then slipped away. When the blades\\r\\nsprang up and brought forth fruit weeds appeared also. The\\r\\nhouseholder\\'s servants came to him and asked, Sir, did thou not sow\\r\\ngood seed in the field? Where did the tares come from? The householder\\r\\nanswered, An enemy has done this. The servants then asked, Shall we go\\r\\nand pull them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares,\\r\\nye shall uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the\\r\\nharvest. Then, at harvest time, I will say to the reapers, First gather\\r\\ntogether the weeds and bind them in bundles. These tares shall ye burn\\r\\nup. Then the wheat is to go in the shelter. Jesus told another parable, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of\\r\\nmustard seed. A man sowed it in his field. Now this, indeed, is the\\r\\nleast of all seeds. However, when it is grown, it is the largest among\\r\\nall the herbs. It grows like a tree so the birds of the air can come\\r\\nand lodge in its branches. Another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven. A woman took a\\r\\nlittle, hid it in three measures of meal and, at last, all was\\r\\nleavened. All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitude.\\r\\nThus it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: I will open\\r\\nmy mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret\\r\\nfrom the foundation of the world. Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went inside. His disciples came\\r\\nto Him and said, Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field.\\r\\nJesus answered and said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man.\\r\\nThe field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom.\\r\\nThe weeds are the children of the wicked one. The enemy that sowed them\\r\\nis the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the\\r\\nangels. As the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it\\r\\nbe in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth His\\r\\nangels. They shall clear out of His kingdom all that offends and does\\r\\niniquity and cast it into a furnace. There shall be wailing and\\r\\ngnashing of teeth. Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in\\r\\nthe kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a\\r\\nman discovers it, he buries it again. Then joyfully he goes and sells\\r\\nall that he has to buy that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like\\r\\na merchant seeking good pearls. When he finds even one pearl of great\\r\\nprice, he goes and sells all he has to buy it. And the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea to\\r\\ngather every kind of fish. When it was full, they drew the net to\\r\\nshore. The good they gathered into vessels. But they cast the bad away.\\r\\nSo shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall come and sever\\r\\nthe wicked from the just and cast them into the furnace where there\\r\\nshall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Jesus asked, Have ye understood all these things? They said, Yea, Lord.\\r\\nThen He said, Therefore, every scribe who is instructed about the\\r\\nkingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth out of his\\r\\ntreasure things both new and old. Jesus went into His own country. He taught in the synagogue. The people\\r\\nwere astonished and said, Whence has He this wisdom and these mighty\\r\\nworks? Is this not the carpenter\\'s son? Is His mother not called Mary\\r\\nand His brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? Are His\\r\\nsisters not here with us? Where did this man get all these things? They were offended by Him. Jesus told them that a prophet is not\\r\\nwithout honor except in His own country and in His own house. He did\\r\\nnot do many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 14\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time Herod heard of the fame of Jesus. He said to his servants,\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is John the Baptist. He is risen from the dead and mighty works\\r\\n\\r\\nshow forth in him.\\n Herod had imprisoned John for the sake of Herodia, his brother Philip\\'s\\r\\n\\r\\nwife. He did this because John told Herod that it was not lawful for\\r\\n\\r\\nHerod to have her. He would have immediately put John to death but\\r\\n\\r\\nHerod feared the multitude, who counted John as a prophet.\\n But when Herod\\'s birthday was celebrated, Herodias\\' daughter danced and\\r\\ngreatly pleased Herod. He promised, with an oath, to give her whatever\\r\\nshe asked. Having previously been instructed by her mother, she said,\\r\\nGive me John the Baptist\\'s head on a charger. Herod was sorry. However,\\r\\nfor the oath\\'s sake and those who sat at dinner with him, he commanded\\r\\nit be given her. He had John beheaded in prison. Then his head was\\r\\nbrought on a charger, presented to her, and she brought it to her\\r\\nmother. Then John\\'s disciples came, took up the body, buried it, and\\r\\nreported it to Jesus. When Jesus heard, He departed from there by boat to a desert place.\\r\\nWhen the people heard this, they followed Him on foot out of the\\r\\ncities. As Jesus went forth He saw a great multitude. He was moved with\\r\\ncompassion toward them and He healed their sick. When it was evening,\\r\\nHis disciples came to Him and said, This is a desert place and it is\\r\\nlate. Send the multitude away so they may go into the villages and buy\\r\\nfood. But Jesus said, They need not depart. Give them food to eat. They\\r\\nsaid, We have only five loaves and two fish. Jesus said, Bring them to\\r\\nme. He told the multitude to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves\\r\\nand the two fish, and, looking up to heaven, He blessed it. Then He\\r\\nbroke and gave the loaves to His disciples, and the disciples gave them\\r\\nto the multitude. They all ate and were full. Afterwards, they took up\\r\\nthe fragments that remained, twelve baskets full. Those who had eaten\\r\\nnumbered about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. Immediately, Jesus instructed His disciples to get into a boat and go\\r\\nahead of Him to the other side. After He sent the multitude away, He\\r\\nwent up into a mountain to pray. When evening came He was there alone.\\r\\nBut the boat was now in the midst of the sea and tossed with waves by\\r\\nthe strong wind. In the fourth watch of the night, the disciples saw\\r\\nJesus walking toward them on the sea. They were afraid and said, It is\\r\\na spirit. They cried out for fear. But Jesus said, Be of good cheer. It\\r\\nis I. Be not afraid. Peter answered and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on\\r\\nthe water. Jesus said, Come. Peter got out of the boat and walked on\\r\\nthe water toward Jesus.  But when he saw the wind, he became afraid and\\r\\nimmediately began to sink. He cried, Lord, save me. Jesus stretched out\\r\\nHis hand, caught Peter, and said, O thou of little faith. Why did thou\\r\\ndoubt? When they got into the boat the wind ceased. Then those who were in the\\r\\nboat came and worshipped Jesus. They said, Surely thou art the Son of\\r\\nGod. Then they reached the land of Gennesaret. When the people there\\r\\nhad knowledge of Him, they sent word all around the country. They\\r\\nbrought to Jesus all who were diseased. They besought Him that they\\r\\nmight only touch the hem of His garment. And all who touched His\\r\\ngarment were made perfectly whole. 15\\r\\nThen scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus. They asked,\\r\\nWhy do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? They do\\r\\nnot wash their hands when they eat bread. Jesus answered, Why do ye\\r\\nalso transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? God\\r\\ncommanded: Honor thy father and mother. Let him be put to death who\\r\\ncurses father or mother. But ye say that whoever says to his father or\\r\\nmother that it is a gift by whatever thou might profit by me,\\r\\ndishonoring the father or mother, shall be free. Your tradition has\\r\\nmade the commandment of God useless. Ye hypocrites. Well did Esaias prophesy: This people draw nigh unto me\\r\\nwith their mouth, and honor me with their lips. But their hearts are\\r\\nfar from me. In vain do they worship me. They teach the commandments of\\r\\nmen as doctrines. Jesus then called the multitude and said, Hear and understand. Nothing\\r\\nthat goes into the mouth defiles a man. But that which comes out of the\\r\\nmouth defiles a man. His disciples approached him and said, Know thou\\r\\nthat the Pharisees were offended after they heard these words? Jesus\\r\\nsaid, Every plant that was not planted by my heavenly Father shall be\\r\\nuprooted. Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. If the\\r\\nblind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. Next, Peter approached Him and said, Explain the parable to us. Jesus\\r\\nreplied, Are ye still without understanding? Do ye not yet understand\\r\\nthat whatever goes in at the mouth goes into the belly and is expelled.\\r\\nBut those things which come out of the mouth come from the heart. They\\r\\ndefile the man because out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders,\\r\\nadulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies. These\\r\\nare the things that defile a man. To eat with unwashed hands does not\\r\\ndefile a man. Then Jesus went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. A woman of Canaan\\r\\ncame to Him and said, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David. My\\r\\ndaughter is grievously tormented with a devil. Jesus said not a word to\\r\\nher. Finally, His disciples came and said, Send her away for she cries\\r\\nafter us. Jesus replied, I am not here for the lost sheep of the house\\r\\nof Israel only. She came forward and worshipped Him. She said, Lord, help me. He\\r\\nanswered, It is not fit to take the children\\'s bread and cast it to\\r\\ndogs. She answered, True, Lord. Yet dogs eat the crumbs that fall from\\r\\ntheir masters\\' table. Jesus said to her, O woman, great is thy faith.\\r\\nBe it done unto thee as thou wilt. So her daughter was made whole from\\r\\nthat very hour. Jesus left and went near the sea of Galilee where He went up into a\\r\\nmountain to rest. Soon, great multitudes came to Him. They brought\\r\\nthose who were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others. They placed\\r\\nthem at Jesus\\' feet and He healed them. The multitude wondered when\\r\\nthey saw the dumb speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking,\\r\\nand the blind seeing. They glorified the God of Israel. Jesus called His disciples aside and said, I have compassion on the\\r\\nmultitude because they have been with me three days and have nothing to\\r\\neat. I will not send them away hungry lest they faint on the way. His\\r\\ndisciples said, Where should we find enough bread in the wilderness to\\r\\nfill so great a multitude? Jesus asked them, How many loaves have ye?\\r\\nThey said, Seven and a few little fish. Jesus commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. He took the\\r\\nseven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. He broke them and gave them\\r\\nto His disciples and the disciples gave them to the multitude. They all\\r\\nate and were full. They took up the food that was left, seven baskets\\r\\nfull. Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.\\r\\nThen Jesus sent away the multitude and took a boat to the coasts of\\r\\nMagdala. 16\\r\\nThe Pharisees and the Sadducees came and, testing Jesus, asked Him to\\r\\nshow them a sign from heaven. He answered and said, When it is evening,\\r\\nye say it will be fair weather because the sky is red. In the morning,\\r\\nye say it will be foul weather because the sky is red. O ye hypocrites. Ye can discern the face of the sky but cannot discern\\r\\nthe signs of the times! It is a wicked and adulterous generation that\\r\\nseeks a sign. There shall be no sign given except the sign of the\\r\\nprophet, Jonas. Then He left them, and departed to the other side. Jesus uttered, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and\\r\\nof the Sadducees. The disciples thought He referred to their not\\r\\nremembering to bring bread along with them. When Jesus perceived this,\\r\\nHe said, O ye of little faith, why do you concern yourselves because ye\\r\\nhave brought no bread? Do ye not yet understand or remember the five\\r\\nloaves for the five thousand and how many baskets of leftovers ye took\\r\\nup? Do ye not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand and how\\r\\nmany baskets of leftovers ye took up? How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke not about the leaven\\r\\nof bread but that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and\\r\\nof the Sadducees? Then they understood that the leaven was the doctrine\\r\\nand teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. When Jesus came to the coast of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His\\r\\n\\r\\ndisciples, Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am? They answered,\\r\\n\\r\\nSome say that thou art John the Baptist. Some say Elias. Others say\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremias or one of the prophets.\\n Then Jesus asked them, But who do ye say that I am? Simon Peter spoke\\r\\nup, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answered and\\r\\nsaid, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not\\r\\nrevealed it to thee, but my Father which is in heaven. I say also unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build\\r\\nmy church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give\\r\\nthee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt bind on\\r\\nearth, shall be bound in heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth,\\r\\nshall be loosed in heaven. Then He charged His disciples to tell no man\\r\\nthat He was Jesus the Christ. From that time forward Jesus instructed His disciples about how He\\r\\nmust go into Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the\\r\\nelders, chief priests, and scribes. He told them He would be killed and\\r\\nbe raised again on the third day. Peter began to rebuke Him and said,\\r\\nFar be it from thee, Lord. This shall not be. Jesus turned quickly,\\r\\nstopped Peter, and said, Get thee behind me, Satan. Thou art an offence\\r\\nto me. Thou savor not the things of God, but those of men. Then Jesus said to His disciples, If any man will come after me, let\\r\\nhim deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. Whoever saves his\\r\\nlife shall lose it. Whoever loses his life, for my sake, shall find it. What is a man profited if he gains the whole world and loses his own\\r\\nsoul? What can a man give in exchange for his soul? The Son of man\\r\\nshall come in the glory of His Father, with His angels and shall reward\\r\\nevery man according to his works. Verily, I say unto you, there are\\r\\nsome standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Son of\\r\\nman coming in His kingdom. 17\\r\\nAfter six days Jesus took Peter, James and his brother, John up into a\\r\\nhigh mountain. Here Jesus was transfigured before them. His face shone\\r\\nas bright as the sun. His raiment was as white as pure light. And,\\r\\nbehold, Moses and Elias appeared and talked with Him. Peter then said, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let\\r\\nus make three tabernacles; one for thee, one for Moses, and one for\\r\\nElias. But, as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. From\\r\\nthe cloud, a voice said, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well\\r\\npleased. Hear ye Him. When the disciples heard, they fell on their faces and were afraid.\\r\\nThen Jesus came, touched them, and said, Arise. Be not afraid. When\\r\\nthey looked up they saw no one but Jesus. As they came down from the\\r\\nmountain, Jesus charged them to tell no one what they witnessed until\\r\\nthe Son of man had risen from the dead. His disciples asked Him, Why, then, do the scribes say that Elias must\\r\\ncome first? Jesus answered, Elias comes first and restores all things.\\r\\nBut I tell you that Elias has already come. They knew him not and\\r\\ncaused him to suffer at their hands. Likewise, the Son of man shall\\r\\nalso suffer of them. Then the disciples understood that Jesus meant\\r\\nJohn the Baptist. As they approached the multitude, a man came up to Jesus. Kneeling\\r\\ndown, the man said, Lord, have mercy on my son. He is lunatic and\\r\\ngreatly vexed. He often falls into the fire and into the water. I\\r\\nbrought my son to thy disciples but they could not cure him. Jesus said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be\\r\\nwith you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring the boy here to me. When\\r\\nJesus rebuked the devil, he departed out of the child and the boy was\\r\\ncured from that very hour. The disciples took Jesus aside and asked, Why could we not cast the\\r\\ndevil out? Jesus answered, Because of your unbelief. Verily, I say unto\\r\\nyou, if ye have the faith of a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to\\r\\nthis mountain, Move yonder and it shall move. Nothing shall be\\r\\nimpossible. This kind of devil goes out only after much strengthening\\r\\nof faith by prayer and fasting. During their time in Galilee, Jesus told all His disciples, The Son of\\r\\nman shall be betrayed into the hands of men. They shall kill Him and,\\r\\non the third day, He shall be raised again. The disciples felt great\\r\\nsorrow. When they arrived at Capernaum, those who collected tribute money came\\r\\nto Peter and questioned him saying, Does your master pay tribute? Peter\\r\\nsaid, Yes. When Peter came into the house, Jesus stopped him and said, What think\\r\\nthou, Simon? Should the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of\\r\\ntheir own children or of strangers? Peter replied, Of strangers. Jesus\\r\\nsaid, So then, the children are free. Then Jesus added, Nonetheless, so we do not offend them, go to the sea,\\r\\ncast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. In his mouth\\r\\nthou shalt find a coin. Take that and give it to those who collect the\\r\\ntribute money for me and thee. 18\\r\\nAt the same time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, Who is the\\r\\ngreatest in the kingdom of heaven? Jesus called a little child to Him,\\r\\nset him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Unless\\r\\nyou are converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter\\r\\ninto the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself\\r\\nlike this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever shall receive a little child in my name receives me. But\\r\\nwhoever offends one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be\\r\\nbetter for him that a millstone were hung around his neck and he drown\\r\\nin the deep of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! It must needs be that offences\\r\\ncome; but woe to the one by whom the offence comes! Therefore, if thy\\r\\nhand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off and cast them from thee. It\\r\\nis better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than\\r\\nhaving two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if\\r\\nthine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. It is better\\r\\nfor thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes\\r\\nto be cast into hell fire. Take heed that ye despise not one of these\\r\\nlittle ones; for I say unto you, In heaven their angels always look\\r\\nupon the face of my Father. The Son of man is here to save that which was lost. How think ye? If a\\r\\nman has a hundred sheep, and one of them is gone astray, does he not\\r\\nleave the ninety and nine and go into the mountains to seek the one\\r\\ngone astray? And if he find it, he rejoices more over that sheep than\\r\\nof the ninety and nine which did not stray. So, it is not the will of\\r\\nyour Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If thy brother trespasses against thee, go and tell him his fault\\r\\nbetween thee and him alone. If he will hear thee, thou has gained thy\\r\\nbrother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two\\r\\nmore, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be\\r\\nestablished. If he neglects to hear them, tell it to the church. But if\\r\\nhe neglects to hear the church, let him be treated as a heathen and a\\r\\npublican. Whatever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven. Whatever ye\\r\\nshall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. If two of you shall\\r\\nagree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be\\r\\ndone for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are\\r\\ngathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin\\r\\nagainst me and I forgive him? Until seven times? Jesus replied, I say\\r\\nunto thee, not until seven times but until seventy times seven. The kingdom of heaven is like a king who took an account of his\\r\\nservants. When he began to reckon, one was brought to him who owed him\\r\\nten thousand talents. But since he was unable to pay, his lord\\r\\ncommanded him to be sold, along with his wife, and children, and all\\r\\nthat he had, and payment to be made. The servant fell down and\\r\\nworshipped him saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay thee\\r\\nall. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, loosed\\r\\nhim, and forgave him the debt. This same servant left and met one of his fellowservants who owed him a\\r\\nsmall sum. He laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying, Pay\\r\\nme what thou owe. The fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought\\r\\nhim saying, have patience with me and I will pay thee all. But he would\\r\\nnot. He cast him into prison until the debt was paid. When the rest of\\r\\nthe servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and went to their\\r\\nlord and told him everything. Then the servant\\'s lord called him and said, O, thou wicked servant! I\\r\\nforgave thee all that debt because thou desired it of me. Should not\\r\\nthou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant as I had pity on\\r\\nthee? His lord was angry and delivered him to the tormentors until he\\r\\npaid all that was due. So also shall my heavenly Father do to you if ye\\r\\ndo not forgive other\\'s trespasses. 19\\r\\nIt came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed\\r\\nfrom Galilee and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan. Great\\r\\nmultitudes followed Him and He healed many there. The Pharisees also\\r\\ncame to test Him. They questioned Him saying, Is it lawful for a man to\\r\\nput away his wife for every cause? Jesus answered, have ye not read that He who made them at the beginning\\r\\nmade them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave\\r\\nfather and mother and shall cleave to his wife. The two shall be one?\\r\\nTherefore, they are no longer two but one flesh. What God has joined\\r\\ntogether, let no man put asunder. They said, Why, then, did Moses allow a writing of divorcement to put a\\r\\nwife away? Jesus said, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts,\\r\\nsuffered you to put away your wives. But, from the beginning, it was\\r\\nnot so. I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for\\r\\nfornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery. Whoever marries\\r\\nher who is put away also commits adultery. His disciples said, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is\\r\\nnot good to marry. Jesus said, All men cannot receive this saying,\\r\\nexcept those to whom this saying is given. There are some eunuchs who\\r\\nwere so born from their mother\\'s womb. There are some eunuchs who were\\r\\nmade eunuchs by men. And there are eunuchs who have made themselves\\r\\neunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\\'s sake. He that is able to receive\\r\\nit, let him receive it. Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on\\r\\nthem and pray. When the disciples rebuked them Jesus said, Allow these\\r\\nlittle children and do not forbid them to come to me; for of such is\\r\\nthe kingdom of heaven. Jesus laid His hands on them, and then departed. Behold, a young man came to Him and asked, Good Master, what shall I do\\r\\nthat I may have eternal life? He said to him, Why call me good? There\\r\\nis none good but one, and that is God. But if thou wilt enter into\\r\\nlife, keep the commandments. The young man asked, Which? Jesus said,\\r\\nThou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not\\r\\nsteal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy\\r\\nmother. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The young man said, All these things I have kept from my youth up. What\\r\\ndo I yet lack? Jesus answered, If thou will be perfect, go and sell\\r\\nwhat you have and give to the poor. Thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\\r\\nThen come and follow me. But when the young man heard that saying he\\r\\nwent away sorrowful because he had many possessions. Then said Jesus to His disciples, Hardly a rich man shall enter into\\r\\nthe kingdom of heaven. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye\\r\\nof a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When\\r\\nHis disciples heard this they were greatly amazed. They asked, Who,\\r\\nthen, can be saved? Jesus beheld them and said, With men it is\\r\\nimpossible; but with God all things are possible. Peter asked, Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee. What shall\\r\\nwe have? Jesus said, Verily, at the regeneration, when the Son of man\\r\\nshall sit in the throne of His glory, ye who have followed me shall\\r\\nalso sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Everyone who has forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father,\\r\\nor mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name\\'s sake, shall\\r\\nreceive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many\\r\\nthat are first shall be last; and the last shall be first. 20\\r\\nThe kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the\\r\\nmorning to hire laborers for his vineyard. When he had agreed with the\\r\\nlaborers for a coin a day, he sent them into his vineyard. Then, about\\r\\nthe third hour he went out and saw others standing idle in the\\r\\nmarketplace. He said to them, Go ye also into my vineyard and whatever\\r\\nis right I will give you. He went out again about the sixth and the ninth hour and did the same.\\r\\nAbout the eleventh hour he went out, found others standing idle, and\\r\\nsaid, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They answered, Because no man\\r\\nhas hired us. He then replied, Go ye also into the vineyard and\\r\\nwhatever is right you shall receive. When evening came, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call\\r\\nthe laborers and give them their pay, beginning from the last unto the\\r\\nfirst. When those who were hired about the eleventh hour came, every\\r\\nman received a coin. But when the first came, supposing they should\\r\\nreceive more, they each also received a coin. When they received it,\\r\\nthey murmured against the good man of the house and said, These last\\r\\nhave worked but one hour and thou has made them equal to those of us\\r\\nwho have borne the burden and heat of the day. He answered one of them and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong. Did thou\\r\\nnot agree with me for a coin? Take what is thine and go thy way. I will\\r\\ngive to the last the same as I give to thee. Is it not lawful for me to\\r\\ndo what I will with my own coins? Must you see evil in my goodness? So, the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are called,\\r\\nbut few are chosen. Then Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve\\r\\ndisciples aside and said, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem where the Son\\r\\nof man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and scribes. They will\\r\\ncondemn Him to death. They will deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock,\\r\\nscourge, and crucify Him. And on the third day He shall rise again. The mother of the sons of Zebedee and her sons, James and John,\\r\\napproached Jesus. She praised Him, desiring something of Him. He said\\r\\nto her, What wilt thou? She replied, Grant that my two sons may sit,\\r\\none on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom. But\\r\\nJesus answered, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the\\r\\ncup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I\\r\\nam baptized with? They said to Him, We are able. And Jesus said, Ye shall drink indeed of\\r\\nmy cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but\\r\\nto sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give. It shall be\\r\\ngiven to them for whom it is prepared by my Father. When the remaining ten heard this they were moved with indignation\\r\\nagainst the two brethren. But Jesus called them to Him and said, Ye\\r\\nknow that the princes of worldliness and ambition influence them. But\\r\\nit shall not be so among you. Whoever will be great among you, let him\\r\\nbe your minister. Whoever will be chief among you, let him be your\\r\\nservant. Likewise, the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to\\r\\nminister, and to give His life as a ransom for many. When they departed from Jericho a great multitude followed. Behold,\\r\\nwhen they heard that Jesus passed by, two blind men who were sitting by\\r\\nthe wayside cried out, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. The\\r\\nmultitude rebuked them and told them to keep quiet. But they cried\\r\\nmore, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. Jesus stood still and said to them, What shall I do for you? They\\r\\nanswered, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. Jesus had compassion and\\r\\ntouched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and they\\r\\nfollowed Him. 21\\r\\nAs they drew close to Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage by the mount of\\r\\nOlives. Jesus sent two disciples ahead and said, Go into the village\\r\\nand ye shall find tied there an ass with her colt. Untie them and bring\\r\\nthem to me. If a man says anything to you, say, The Lord has need of\\r\\nthem and, straightway, he will send them. All this was done so this\\r\\nsaying of the prophet might be fulfilled: Tell ye the daughter of Sion,\\r\\nBehold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon a colt, the\\r\\nfoal of an ass. The disciples did as Jesus directed. They brought the ass and the colt\\r\\nand set Jesus thereupon. A multitude spread out their garments and\\r\\nothers cut down tree branches and lined the way. They cried out,\\r\\nHosanna to the son of David. Blessed is He that comes in the name of\\r\\nthe Lord. Hosanna in the highest. When Jesus came into Jerusalem, all\\r\\nthe city was stirred. They asked, Who is this? The multitude said, This\\r\\nis Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee. Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all who bought and sold.\\r\\nHe overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who\\r\\nsold doves. He said to them, It is written that my house shall be\\r\\ncalled a house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. The blind and the lame came to Him in the temple and He healed them.\\r\\nWhen the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things Jesus did\\r\\nand heard the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the son of\\r\\nDavid; they were greatly displeased. They said to Him, Hear thou what\\r\\nthey are saying? Jesus answered, Yea. Have ye never read, Out of the\\r\\nmouth of babes comes perfect praise? Then He left them and went into\\r\\nBethany where He lodged that night. In the morning Jesus, being very hungry, started out to return to the\\r\\ncity. On His way He saw a fig tree. As He came to it He found nothing\\r\\non it but leaves. He said, Let no fruit ever grow on thee. The fig tree\\r\\nwithered away. When the disciples saw this, they marvelled and said, How quickly the\\r\\nfig tree withered away! Jesus answered, If ye have faith, and doubt\\r\\nnot, ye shall not only do this that was done to the fig tree, but also,\\r\\nif ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and cast into the\\r\\nsea; it shall be done. The things ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye\\r\\nshall receive. Then He went into the temple. The chief priests and the elders of the\\r\\npeople came to Him as He was teaching and asked, By what authority do\\r\\nyou do these things? Who gave thee this authority? Jesus replied, I, in turn, will ask you one thing, which, if ye can\\r\\ntell me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Did the\\r\\nbaptism of John come from heaven or from man? They reasoned among themselves and said, If we say, From heaven; He\\r\\nwill ask us, Why did ye not then believe him? But if we say, From man;\\r\\nwe fear the people for they hold John as a prophet. Finally they said to Jesus, We cannot tell. Jesus responded, Neither,\\r\\nthen, do I tell you by what authority I do these things. Hear this. A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, Son,\\r\\ntoday go to work in my vineyard. The son answered, I will not. But,\\r\\nafterward he repented and went to work. Then the man went to the second\\r\\nson and said the same thing. The second son said, I will go, sir;  but\\r\\nhe did not go. Which of these two did the will of his father? They\\r\\nanswered, The first son. Jesus said, Verily I say, The publicans and the harlots enter the\\r\\nkingdom of God before you. John came to you in the way of righteousness\\r\\nand ye believed him not. But the publicans and the harlots believed\\r\\nhim. And ye, even after ye had seen, did not repent that ye believed\\r\\nhim. Hear another parable: There was a householder who planted a vineyard.\\r\\nHe hedged it all around, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then\\r\\nhe rented it out to husbandsmen and went abroad. When the time of the\\r\\nharvest drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandsmen to receive\\r\\nthe fruits of it. The husbandsmen took his servants, beat one, stoned\\r\\none, and killed another. Next, he sent more servants than the first\\r\\ntime. They did to them the same thing. Finally, he sent his son,\\r\\nsaying, They will respect my son. But when the husbandsmen saw the son,\\r\\nthey said, This is the heir. Let us kill him and seize his inheritance.\\r\\nSo they caught him, cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When,\\r\\ntherefore, the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to these\\r\\nhusbandsmen? They said to Jesus, He will destroy these miserable and wicked men and\\r\\nhe will rent out his vineyard to others who will render him the fruits\\r\\nin their seasons. Jesus said, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the\\r\\nbuilders rejected is the same that has become the cornerstone; this is\\r\\nthe Lord\\'s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes? I tell you, The\\r\\nkingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation that\\r\\nbrings forth its fruits. Whoever falls on this stone shall be broken.\\r\\nOn whomever this stone falls, he will be ground into powder. When the chief priests and Pharisees heard these parables, they saw\\r\\nthat Jesus spoke about them. But when they thought of laying hands on\\r\\nHim, they feared the multitude because they took Jesus for a prophet. 22\\r\\nJesus related more parables. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like a\\r\\nking who arranged a marriage feast for his son. He sent his servants\\r\\nforth to call those who were invited to the wedding but they did not\\r\\ncome. He sent other servants to say, Dinner is prepared. The king\\'s\\r\\noxen and fatlings are killed. Everything is ready. Come to the\\r\\nmarriage. Those who were invited made light of it and went their ways.\\r\\nOne went out to his farm. Another attended to his merchandise. The\\r\\nothers took the king\\'s servants, treated them spitefully, and then slew\\r\\nthem. When the king heard this he was outraged. He sent out his armies to\\r\\ndestroy the murderers and burn their city. Then he said to his\\r\\nservants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not\\r\\nworthy. Go into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, invite them\\r\\nto the marriage feast. These servants went out and gathered together\\r\\nall those they found, both bad and good, and the wedding was furnished\\r\\nwith guests. Then, the king came in to greet the guests. He spotted a man who did\\r\\nnot wear the wedding garment that was provided. The king said to him,\\r\\nFriend, why did you come in here without the wedding garment? The man\\r\\nmade no answer. So the king told his servants, Bind him hand and foot.\\r\\nThen take him away and cast him into outer darkness. There shall be\\r\\nweeping and gnashing of teeth, for many are called but few are chosen. Then the Pharisees met to discuss how they might trap Jesus in His\\r\\nwords. They sent some of their people along with the herodians to\\r\\nquestion Jesus. They said, Master, we know that thou art true and teach\\r\\nthe way of God in truth. Tell us, therefore, what thou think. Is it\\r\\nlawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? Jesus, perceiving their wicked motive, said, Why test me, ye\\r\\nhypocrites? Show me the tribute money. They brought a coin to Him.\\r\\nJesus asked, Whose image and superscription is this? They said,\\r\\nCaesar\\'s. Jesus said, Render, therefore, unto Caesar the things which\\r\\nare Caesar\\'s; and to God the things that are God\\'s. When they heard\\r\\nthese words, they marvelled, and left Him to go their way. The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to\\r\\nHim and asked, Master, Moses said if a man dies and has no children,\\r\\nhis brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.\\r\\nNow there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he married a\\r\\nwife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother.\\r\\nLikewise, the second also, and the third, up to the seventh brother.\\r\\nThen, finally the woman died also. Now, according to the resurrection,\\r\\nwhose wife shall she be of the seven since they all had her? Jesus said, Ye err. You do not know the scriptures nor the power of\\r\\nGod. In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage,\\r\\nbut are as the angels of God in heaven. Concerning the resurrection of\\r\\nthe dead, have ye not read: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of\\r\\nIsaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the\\r\\nliving. When the multitude heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.\\r\\nBut when the Pharisees heard that Jesus put the Sadducees to silence,\\r\\nthey gathered together. One of them, a lawyer, tested Jesus with this\\r\\nquestion, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus\\r\\nanswered, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with\\r\\nall thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great\\r\\ncommandment. And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour\\r\\nas thyself. On these two commandments rests all the law and the\\r\\nprophets. While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, What\\r\\nthink ye of Christ? Whose son is He? They said, The son of David. Jesus\\r\\nthen asked, How, then, does David, in spirit, call him Lord, saying,\\r\\nThe Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine\\r\\nenemies thy footstool? If David calls him Lord, how is he his son? No\\r\\nman was able to answer a word, nor dare any man from that day forth ask\\r\\nJesus any more questions. 23\\r\\nThen Jesus spoke to the crowd and to His followers. He said, The\\r\\nscribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses\\' place. Whatsoever they bid you\\r\\nto observe and do, ye shall observe and do. But do not follow after\\r\\ntheir works because what they say, they do not do themselves. They bind\\r\\nheavy burdens, grievous to be borne, and lay them on men\\'s shoulders.\\r\\nBut they, themselves, will not even lay so much as a finger on one of\\r\\nthem. All their works they do for show to other men. They love the\\r\\nuppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues. They\\r\\nlike greetings in the markets and to be called out to, Rabbi, Rabbi. But be ye not called Rabbi. Only one is your teacher, even Christ; and\\r\\nye are all brethren. Call no man on earth your father, for only one is\\r\\nyour Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters, for only\\r\\none is your Master, even Christ. Also, he that is greatest among you\\r\\nshall be your servant. Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased;\\r\\nand he that shall be humbled shall be exalted. But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Hypocrites! Ye shut men out of\\r\\nthe kingdom of heaven, ye enter not in yourselves, and you do not allow\\r\\nothers to attempt to enter in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees.\\r\\nHypocrites! Ye devour widows\\' houses and, for a pretence, make long\\r\\nprayers. Therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Hypocrites! Ye venture over sea\\r\\nand land for one proselyte and, when he is made, ye make him twofold\\r\\nmore the child of hell than yourselves. Woe unto you, ye blind guides\\r\\nwho say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, is worth nothing; but\\r\\nwhosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, makes a good pledge!\\r\\nYe fools and blind men. What is greater, the gold or the temple that\\r\\nsanctifies the gold? And ye say, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, is worth nothing; but\\r\\nwhosoever swears by the gift that is upon it, is worthy of praise. Ye\\r\\nfools and blind men. What is greater, the gift, or the altar that\\r\\nsanctifies the gift? Whoso, therefore, shall swear by the altar, swears\\r\\nby it and by all things upon it. And whoso shall swear by the temple,\\r\\nswears by it and by Him that dwells therein. And He that shall swear by\\r\\nheaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him that sits thereon. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Hypocrites! Ye pay tithe of mint\\r\\nand anise and cummin, but ye have ignored the weightier matters of the\\r\\nlaw; judgment, mercy, and faith. Ye blind guides who strain from your\\r\\ndrink a gnat and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Hypocrites! Ye make the outside of\\r\\nthe cup and platter clean, but inside they are full of extortion and\\r\\nexcess. Thou blind Pharisee. Cleanse first that which is inside the cup\\r\\nand platter so the outside may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Hypocrites! Ye are like whited\\r\\nsepulchres, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full\\r\\nof dead men\\'s bones and uncleanness. Even if ye also outwardly appear\\r\\nrighteous unto men, inside ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees. Hypocrites! Ye build the tombs for\\r\\nthe prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous. Ye say, If we\\r\\nhad lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers\\r\\nwith them in the blood of the prophets. Be witnesses unto yourselves.\\r\\nYe are the children of those who killed the prophets and ye measure up\\r\\nto your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation\\r\\nof hell? I send prophets,  wise men, and scribes. Some of them ye shall\\r\\nkill and crucify. Some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and\\r\\npersecute them from city to city. On your hands shall be the blood of\\r\\nall the righteous shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel\\r\\nto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the\\r\\ntemple and the altar. All these things shall come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killed the prophets, and stoned those\\r\\nsent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together,\\r\\neven as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not\\r\\nhave it! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. Ye shall not see\\r\\nme again until ye shall say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the\\r\\nLord. 24\\r\\nJesus went outside and His disciples came to show Him the buildings of\\r\\nthe temple. Jesus said, Take note of all these things. There shall not\\r\\nbe left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. On\\r\\nthe mount of Olives, the disciples said, Tell us, when will these\\r\\nthings happen? What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of\\r\\nthe world? Jesus answered, Take heed that no man deceive you. Many shall come in\\r\\nmy name, saying, I am Christ and they shall deceive many. Ye shall hear\\r\\nof wars and rumours of wars. See that ye are not troubled. All these\\r\\nthings must come to pass but the end is not come yet. Nation shall rise\\r\\nagainst nation and kingdom against kingdom. There shall be famines,\\r\\npestilence, and earthquakes in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. They will deliver you up to be\\r\\nafflicted. They shall kill you. Ye shall be hated by all nations for my\\r\\nname\\'s sake. Many will be offended and will betray and hate one\\r\\nanother. False prophets shall arise and deceive. And, because iniquity\\r\\nshall abound, the love of many will wax cold. But those who endure unto\\r\\nthe end shall be saved. This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached all around the world as a\\r\\nwitness to all nations. Then the end shall come. When ye see the\\r\\nabomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet, Daniel, stand in\\r\\nthe holy place; understand the prophecy. Let those who are in Judaea flee into the mountains. Let him stay who\\r\\nis on the housetop and not come down to take anything out of his house.\\r\\nNeither let he who is in the field return to get his clothing. Woe unto\\r\\nthe women who are with child. Pray that your flight be not in the winter or on the sabbath day. There\\r\\nshall be great tribulation, such as was not seen from the beginning of\\r\\nthe world until now and will never be seen again. Unless those days are\\r\\nnumbered, no flesh shall be saved. But, for the elect\\'s sake, those\\r\\ndays shall be numbered. Thus, if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or there He is;\\r\\nbelieve it not. There shall arise false Christs and false prophets.\\r\\nThey will show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it be\\r\\npossible, they will deceive the very elect. Behold, I tell you all this beforehand. So, if they say to you, Behold,\\r\\nHe is in the desert, do not go forth. Or, behold, He is in the secret\\r\\nchambers, believe it not. For, just as the lightning comes out of the\\r\\neast and shines over unto the west, so also shall be the coming of the\\r\\nSon of man. Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be\\r\\ndarkened. The moon will not reflect light. The stars will fall from\\r\\nheaven. The powers of the heavens shall be shaken. All the people of\\r\\nthe earth shall mourn. Then the sign of the Son of man will appear. They shall see Him coming\\r\\nin the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. He shall send His\\r\\nangels with a great sound of a trumpet. His angels will gather together\\r\\nHis elect from the four winds and from one end of heaven to the other. Now learn a parable about the fig tree. When its branch is yet tender\\r\\nand puts forth leaves, ye know that summer is near. So, likewise, when\\r\\nye see all these things, know what is near. This generation shall not pass away until all these things are\\r\\nfulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not\\r\\npass away. But, of the day and the hour no man knows, no, not the\\r\\nangels of heaven, but only my Father. The coming of the Son of man shall be like in the days of Noah. Before\\r\\nthe flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in\\r\\nmarriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark. They knew\\r\\nnothing until the flood came and took them all away. So shall also be\\r\\nthe coming of the Son of man. At that time, two shall be in the field. One shall be taken and the\\r\\nother left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill. One shall be taken\\r\\nand the other left. Watch, for ye know not what hour your Lord comes. Know this, If the good man of the house had known in what watch the\\r\\nthief would come, he would have guarded and would not have suffered his\\r\\nhouse to be broken into. Therefore, be ready. At an hour that ye think\\r\\nthe Son of man will not come, then He will come. It is a faithful and wise servant who, his lord having given him charge\\r\\nover the household, prepares the foods in due season. Blessed is that\\r\\nservant who, when his lord arrives, shall find him doing so. He shall\\r\\nmake the servant ruler over all his goods. It is an evil servant who says, My lord delays his coming so I shall\\r\\ntake advantage. He smites his fellowservants and eats and drinks until\\r\\ndrunken. The lord of that servant shall come in a day when the servant\\r\\ndoes not expect him. At a time when the servant is unaware, he shall be\\r\\ncut asunder and thrown out with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping\\r\\nand gnashing of teeth. 25\\r\\nThe kingdom of heaven is likened unto ten virgins who took their lamps\\r\\nand went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise. Five were\\r\\nfoolish. The foolish took their lamps but no extra oil with them. The\\r\\nwise took oil in their vessels along with their lamps. While the\\r\\nbridegroom tarried, they all slumbered. At midnight there was a cry,\\r\\nBehold, the bridegroom is coming. Go out to meet Him. All the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the\\r\\nwise, Give us some of your oil for our lamps are gone out. But the wise\\r\\nanswered, No, there will be not enough for us and you. Go to them that\\r\\nsell oil and buy some. While they went to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. Those who were\\r\\nready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut. Much\\r\\nlater, the other virgins arrived and called, Lord, Lord, open the door\\r\\nto us. But He answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I do not know\\r\\nyou. Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein\\r\\nthe Son of man comes. The kingdom of heaven is like a man who travels into a far country.\\r\\nBefore he leaves he calls his servants and turns his goods over to\\r\\nthem. To one he gives five talents. To another he gives two talents. To\\r\\nanother he gives one. He gives to every man according to his ability. The servant who received the five talents traded and made another five\\r\\ntalents. He who received two, gained another two. But the servant that\\r\\nreceived one, dug a hole in the earth and hid his lord\\'s money. After a long time, the lord returned from his journey and reckoned with\\r\\nhis servants. He who received five talents came and brought another\\r\\nfive talents. He said, Lord, thou delivered five talents to me. Behold,\\r\\nI have gained five more talents besides them. His lord said, Well done.\\r\\nThou has been faithful over a few things so I will make thee ruler over\\r\\nmany things. Enter into the joy of thy lord! He who received two talents came and said, Lord, thou delivered to me\\r\\ntwo talents. Behold, I have gained two more talents beside them. His\\r\\nlord said, Well done. Thou has been faithful over a few things. I will\\r\\nmake thee ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of thy lord! Then the servant who received the one talent came and said, Lord, I\\r\\nknow that thou art a hard man who reaps where he has not sown and\\r\\ngathers where he has not toiled. I was afraid, so I hid thy talent in\\r\\nthe earth. Here, now thou has what is thine. His lord cried, Thou wicked and slothful servant. Thou knew that I reap\\r\\nwhere I sow not and gather where I do not toil. Thou ought to have, at\\r\\nleast, put my money out to the exchangers so, upon my return, I should\\r\\nhave received my own money with interest. Take the talent and give it\\r\\nto the one who has ten talents. To the one who uses his talent wisely, more shall be given, and he\\r\\nshall have abundance. But to the one who does not, any talent he has\\r\\nshall be taken away. The unprofitable servant shall be cast into outer\\r\\ndarkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. When the Son of man comes with His holy angels, He shall sit upon the\\r\\nthrone of His glory. Before Him shall be gathered all nations. He shall\\r\\nseparate them one from another as a shepherd divides his sheep from his\\r\\ngoats. He shall set the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on the\\r\\nleft. Then the King shall say to those on His right, Come, ye blessed of my\\r\\nFather. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the\\r\\nworld. For I was hungry and ye gave me food. I was thirsty and ye gave\\r\\nme drink. I was a stranger and ye took me in. I was naked and ye\\r\\nclothed me. I was sick and ye visited me. I was in prison and ye came\\r\\nto me. Then the righteous shall ask Him, Lord, when did we see thee hungry and\\r\\nfeed thee? Or thirsty and gave thee drink? When did we see thee a\\r\\nstranger and take thee in? Or naked and clothe thee? When did we see\\r\\nthee sick, or in prison and come to thee? The King shall answer,\\r\\nVerily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least\\r\\nof my brethren, ye have done it to me. Then He shall say to those on the left, Depart from me into the\\r\\neverlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. I was hungry\\r\\nand ye gave me no food. I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink. I was a\\r\\nstranger and ye did not take me in. I was naked and ye did not clothe\\r\\nme. I was sick and in prison and ye did not visit me. Then they shall also ask Him, Lord, when did we see thee hungry or\\r\\nthirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and not\\r\\nminister unto thee? He shall answer them, Inasmuch as ye did not do\\r\\nthese things to one of the least of my brethren, ye did not do it to\\r\\nme. These shall go to everlasting punishment. And the righteous shall\\r\\nhave life eternal. 26\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings He said to\\r\\n\\r\\nHis disciples, In two days is the feast of the passover. The Son of man\\r\\n\\r\\nwill be betrayed and crucified.\\n At the same time the chief priests, scribes, and elders of the people\\r\\nheld a meeting in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas. They\\r\\ndiscussed how they might take Jesus by stealth and kill Him. But they\\r\\nsaid, It cannot happen on the feast day lest there be an uproar among\\r\\nthe people. Jesus was now in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper. There He was\\r\\napproached by a woman carrying an alabaster box containing very\\r\\nprecious ointment. She, then, annointed His head as He sat at dinner. When His disciples saw it they were indignant and said, To what purpose\\r\\nis this waste? This ointment could have been sold for much and the\\r\\nmoney given to the poor. When Jesus overheard them He said, Why bother\\r\\nthis woman? She has wrought a good work upon me. The poor ye have\\r\\nalways with you; but me ye have not always. In annointing me, she\\r\\nprepared me for my burial. Anywhere in the world this gospel is\\r\\npreached it shall also be told what this woman has done. Then, one of the twelve, Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests. He\\r\\nasked, What will ye give me if I will deliver Jesus unto you? They\\r\\nagreed on thirty pieces of silver and, from that time, Judas looked for\\r\\nan opportunity to betray Him. On the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to\\r\\nJesus and asked, Where shall we prepare for thee to eat the passover?\\r\\nJesus told them to go into the city to a certain man and tell him that\\r\\nthe Master says His time is at hand. Tell this man that He will keep\\r\\nthe passover there with His disciples. Then the disciples did as Jesus\\r\\nhad appointed and they prepared the passover. When it was evening, Jesus sat down with the twelve. While they ate He\\r\\nsaid, Verily I say unto you, one of you shall betray me. The disciples\\r\\nheard this with great sorrow and, all at the same time uttered, Lord,\\r\\nis it me? Jesus only said, He that dips his hand in the dish with me\\r\\nshall betray me. It is written: Woe unto the one by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It\\r\\nhad been better for him if he had not been born. Then Judas, who\\r\\nbetrayed Him, asked, Master, is it me? Jesus turned to him and quietly\\r\\nsaid, Thou has said right. While they ate, Jesus took up the bread and blessed it. He then broke\\r\\nit and gave it to the disciples saying, Take this and eat for this is\\r\\nmy body. Then He took the cup and gave thanks. He passed it to them\\r\\nsaying, Drink ye all from this for this is my blood of the new\\r\\ntestament which is shed for many for the remission of sins. I say unto\\r\\nyou, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day\\r\\nwhen I drink it with you in my Father\\'s kingdom. Following the meal,\\r\\nthey sang hymns and went out into the mount of Olives. Jesus said to the disciples, Ye shall all be offended this night\\r\\nbecause of me for it is written: I will smite the shepherd, and the\\r\\nsheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But, after I am risen\\r\\nagain, I will go before you into Galilee. Peter said to Him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, I\\r\\nwill never be offended. Jesus answered Peter, This night, before the\\r\\ncock crows, thou shalt deny me thrice. Peter replied, Though I should\\r\\ndie with thee, I will not deny thee. Then all the disciples said the\\r\\nsame. Jesus took them into a place called Gethsemane and said, Sit here while\\r\\n\\r\\nI go yonder to pray. He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with\\r\\n\\r\\nHim. He said to these three, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful and heavy\\r\\n\\r\\nunto death. Stay here and watch with me.\\n He went off a little farther and fell on His face. Jesus prayed,\\r\\nsaying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.\\r\\nNevertheless, be it not as I will, but as Thou wilt. Then He went to the three disciples and found them asleep. He said to\\r\\nPeter, Could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray so ye do not\\r\\ngive in to this temptation again because, while the spirit may be\\r\\nwilling, the flesh is weak. He went away a second time and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup\\r\\nmay not pass away from me unless I drink it, then Thy will be done.\\r\\nReturning to the three, He, again, found that they had been asleep for\\r\\ntheir eyes were heavy. He left them and went to pray a third time,\\r\\nsaying the same words. When Jesus went back to all the disciples He said, Behold, the hour is\\r\\nat hand. The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. The one\\r\\nwho betrays me is at hand. While He spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came with a great\\r\\nmultitude. They were armed with swords and staves from the chief\\r\\npriests and elders of the people. Judas had agreed on a sign saying,\\r\\nWhomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He. Hold Him fast. Judas\\r\\napproached Jesus, greeted Him; then kissed Him. Jesus said to him,\\r\\nFriend, wherefore art thou come? Then they came and took hold of Jesus. Behold, one who was with Jesus drew his sword, and, striking out at one\\r\\nof the high priest\\'s servants, smote off his ear. Jesus said to him,\\r\\nPut thy sword back into its place. All who take to the sword shall\\r\\nperish by the sword. Think thou that I cannot pray to my Father and He\\r\\nshall give me more than twelve legions of angels? But, then, how shall\\r\\nthe scriptures be fulfilled that this is the way it must be? Jesus said to this multitude, Do ye come at me as against a thief with\\r\\nswords and staves to take me? Daily I sat with you teaching in the\\r\\ntemple and ye did not lay hold of me. This was done so the scriptures\\r\\nof the prophets might be fulfilled. When they took hold of Jesus, all the disciples left Him and fled. They\\r\\nled Him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and elders\\r\\nwere assembled. But Peter followed far behind to the high priest\\'s\\r\\npalace. He went in and sat with the servants. The chief priests, elders, and all the council sought false witness\\r\\nagainst Jesus in order to put Him to death. At last, two false\\r\\nwitnesses came and said, This one said He was able to destroy the\\r\\ntemple of God and build it up again in three days. The high priest arose and said to Jesus, Answerest thou nothing? What\\r\\nis it that they witness against thee? But Jesus said nothing. Then the\\r\\nhigh priest said to Him, I adjure thee, by the living God, tell us\\r\\nwhether thou are the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus replied, Thou has\\r\\nsaid so. I say unto you, hereafter, ye shall see the Son of man sitting\\r\\non the right hand of power and appearing in the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest cried, He has spoken blasphemy. What further need\\r\\nhave we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard His blasphemy. What\\r\\nthink ye? They answered, He is guilty of death. Then they spit in His\\r\\nface. Others struck Him with the palms of their hands and said,\\r\\nProphesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that struck thee? During this, Peter sat outside the palace. A damsel came up to him and\\r\\nsaid, Thou also was with Jesus of Galilee. But Peter denied this and he\\r\\nwent out on the porch. Another maid saw him and said to the others\\r\\nstanding there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. Peter\\r\\ndenied this with an oath and said, I do not know the man. Later, one of the bystanders came up to Peter and said, Surely, by thy\\r\\nvoice I know thou art one of them. Peter began to curse and swear and\\r\\nsaid, I know not the man. Then the cock crowed. Peter remembered the\\r\\nwords of Jesus to him: Before the cock crows, thou shall deny me\\r\\nthrice. He went out and wept bitterly. 27\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning all the chief priests and elders met concerning Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed to put Him to death. They bound Him, led Him away, and\\r\\n\\r\\ndelivered Him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.\\n When Judas realized that Jesus was condemned, he repented. He took the\\r\\nthirty pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders. He said,\\r\\nI have sinned. I have betrayed the innocent. They retorted, What is\\r\\nthat to us? So Judas cast down the pieces of silver in the temple.\\r\\nImmediately he went away and hung himself. At the same time, the chief priests took up the silver pieces and said,\\r\\nIt is not lawful to put this into the treasury because it is blood\\r\\nmoney. After they took counsel, they bought the potter\\'s field for the\\r\\nburial of strangers, which became known as The Field of Blood. The\\r\\nprophecy of Jeremy was fulfilled: They took the thirty pieces of\\r\\nsilver, the price for Him that was valued of the children of Israel,\\r\\nand gave them for the potter\\'s field, as the Lord appointed. Jesus now stood before Pilate, the governor. Pilate asked Him, Art thou\\r\\nthe King of the Jews? Jesus replied, Thou sayest so. When Jesus was\\r\\naccused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing. Then\\r\\nPilate asked Him, Hearest thou the things they witness against thee?\\r\\nJesus said never a word. At this the governor marvelled greatly. The custom at the passover feast was for the governor to release a\\r\\nprisoner of the people\\'s choosing. A notable prisoner named Barabbas\\r\\nwas in the prison. Therefore, when the people were gathered together,\\r\\nPilate said, Whom will ye that I release, Barabbas or Jesus, who is\\r\\ncalled Christ? While he was seated on the judgment seat, Pilate\\'s wife sent a message\\r\\nto him that said, Have nothing to do with that just man. Today I have\\r\\nsuffered many things in a dream because of Him. But the chief priests\\r\\nand elders persuaded the multitude to choose Barabbas and destroy\\r\\nJesus. When Pilate, the governor, asked which of the two they chose they said,\\r\\n\\r\\nBarabbas. Pilate asked, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called\\r\\n\\r\\nChrist? They all said, Let Him be crucified.\\n The governor asked, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the\\r\\nmore and shouted, Let Him be crucified. Pilate realized he could not\\r\\nprevail without making a tumult among the people. So he took water,\\r\\nwashed his hands before the multitude, and said, I am innocent of the\\r\\nblood of this just person. See ye to it. The people said, His blood be\\r\\non us, and on our children. Then Pilate released Barabbas. He had Jesus\\r\\nscourged and delivered Him to be crucified. Pilate\\'s soldiers took Jesus into the common hall where the whole band\\r\\nof soldiers gathered around Him. They stripped Him and put a scarlet\\r\\nrobe on Him. They platted a crown of thorns and put it on His head.\\r\\nThen they put a reed in His right hand. Bowing down, they mocked Him\\r\\nsaying, Hail, King of the Jews! They spit on Him, took the reed, and\\r\\nstruck Him on the head. As they were leading Him away to be crucified,\\r\\nthey found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and compelled him to carry\\r\\nthe cross for Jesus. They took Him to a place called Golgotha, or the place of a skull.\\r\\nThere they gave Him vinegar to drink mixed with gall. When Jesus tasted\\r\\nit, He would not drink it. They crucified Him and parted out His\\r\\ngarments by casting lots. Thus the prophecy was fulfilled: They parted\\r\\nmy garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. Then\\r\\nthe soldiers placed a written accusation over His head. It read: This\\r\\nIs Jesus, The King Of The Jews. Two thieves were crucified alongside Jesus, one on His right hand and\\r\\nthe other on His left. As people passed by they reviled Him and called\\r\\nout: Thou that destroys the temple and builds it again in three days,\\r\\nsave thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. The chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked Him. They\\r\\nsaid, He saved others but He cannot save Himself. If He is the King of\\r\\nIsrael, let Him come down from the cross and we will believe Him. He\\r\\ntrusts in God. Let God deliver Him now, if God will have Him, for He\\r\\nsaid, I am the Son of God. From the sixth until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the\\r\\nland. At about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eli, Eli,\\r\\nlama sabachthani? My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? When some of those standing by heard this, they said, This man calls\\r\\nfor Elias. Presently, one of them ran to get a sponge. He filled it\\r\\nwith vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to Jesus to drink. The rest\\r\\nsaid, Leave it alone. Let us see whether Elias will come to save Him.\\r\\nThen Jesus cried again in a loud voice and yielded Himself up. Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The\\r\\nearth shook and the rocks split apart. Graves were opened. The bodies\\r\\nof many saints who slept rose up and, after His resurrection, went into\\r\\nthe holy city and appeared to many. When the centurions who were\\r\\nwatching Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that were done, they\\r\\nbecame afraid and said, Truly this was the Son of God. Many of the women who followed Jesus of Galilee and ministered to Him\\r\\nwere there looking on. Among them was Mary Magdalene; another Mary; and\\r\\nthe mother of Zebedee\\'s children. When evening came, a rich man of\\r\\nArimathaea, named Joseph, who was also Jesus\\' disciple arrived. He went\\r\\nto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth\\r\\nand laid it in his own new tomb which was hewn out of rock. He rolled a\\r\\ngreat stone across the door of the sepulchre and departed. Mary\\r\\nMagdalene and the other Mary sat alongside the sepulchre. The next day following the day of the preparation, the chief priests\\r\\nand Pharisees went to Pilate and said, Sir, that deceiver, while he was\\r\\nyet alive, said that, in three days, He would rise up again. Command\\r\\nthat the sepulchre be made secure until the third day lest His\\r\\ndisciples come by night, steal Him away, and tell the people that He is\\r\\nrisen from the dead. Then the last error will be worse than the first. Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch. Go your way. Make it as secure as\\r\\nye can. The chief priests and the Pharisees went and made the sepulchre\\r\\nsecure by sealing the stone and setting guards to watch. 28\\r\\nAfter the sabbath, near dawn of the first day of the week, Mary\\r\\nMagdalene and the other Mary came to the sepulchre. Behold, there was a\\r\\ngreat earthquake. An angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and\\r\\nrolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance\\r\\nwas like lightning with raiment white as snow. The guards shook with\\r\\nfear of Him and became as dead men. The angel said to the women, Fear not for I know that ye seek Jesus who\\r\\nwas crucified. He is not here for, as He said, He is risen. Come, see\\r\\nthe place where the Lord lay. Then go quickly and tell His disciples\\r\\nthat He is risen from the dead. Behold, He goes before you into\\r\\nGalilee. There ye shall see Him. Lo, I have told you. The women quickly left the sepulchre filled with both fear and great\\r\\njoy. They ran to bring word to Jesus\\' disciples. As they went along\\r\\nJesus met them and greeted them. They went to Him, held Him by the\\r\\nfeet, and worshipped Him. Then Jesus said to them, Be not afraid. Go\\r\\nand tell my brethren to go into Galilee and there they shall see me. Some of the guards on watch went into the city and told the chief\\r\\npriests the things that were done. After an assembly of the elders the\\r\\nsoldiers were offered a large amount of money to say that Jesus\\'\\r\\ndisciples came by night and stole Him away while they slept. The\\r\\nsoldiers were assured they would be protected if this came to the\\r\\ngovernor\\'s ears. They took the money and did as they were told. This\\r\\nreport is common among the Jews until this day. The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain appointed by\\r\\nJesus. When they saw Him, they worshipped Him. Jesus came to them and\\r\\nsaid, All power is given to me in heaven and on earth. Go and teach all\\r\\nnations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of\\r\\nthe Holy Ghost. Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded\\r\\nyou. I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. ———————-\\r\\n11-2002\\r\\nedited by Lightheart\\r\\nPracticeGodsPresence.com End of Project Gutenberg\\'s The Gospel of Matthew for Readers, by Lightheart'"
